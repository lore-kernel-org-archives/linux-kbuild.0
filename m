Putting device trees below "include/" seems weird to me.


I thought, kernel/  is a place where we put something common among
architectures.


"kernel/configs/" was created as a home for cross-arch config fragments.


arch/${ARCH}/configs/  -  arch-specific *_defconfig and *.config
kernel/configs/        -  arch-common  *.config


Likewise,

arch/${ARCH}/boot/dts  -  arch-specific *.dts and *.dtsi
kernel/dts             -  arch-common  *.dtsi


This is just a matter of preference, though.
