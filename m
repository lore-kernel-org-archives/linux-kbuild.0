What I'm trying to find out first is whether "people regularly using 10+
year old compilers for the latest kernels" is a strict subset of "people in
Geert's household".

Given that none of the three architectures I looked at (arm, mips, x86)
has successfully built any defconfig for a few years, it's quite possible
that it's just you ;-) The other architectures that were around 10 years
ago (so they might have someone who still has old toolchain binaries)
and that still exist today are alpha, cris, frv, ia64, m32r, parisc, powerpc,
s390, sh, sparc and xtensa. The first six are similar to m68k in that the
hardware is mostly obsolete and the ports are kept around to support
those old systems that might also use ancient toolchains, or new
toolchains may be unmaintained or buggy, which could be a reason
to keep 4.1 supported or at least try to find out if 4.1 (or even any other
version) still works at all.

What kind of warnings do you see that disappeared with later versions?
Do you know what caused them to disappear in later versions (different
optimization decisions, warning getting disabled by default but still available
for turning on manually, ...)? Do you know if the disabled warnings are
still there in gcc-4.3 (I can try it out if you give me examples)?

If gcc-4.3 produces similarly useful warnings, we could think about integrating
gcc-4.3 into kernelci.org build reports as an option, and fix up all
the existing
warnings we get with that. I wouldn't want to do that with gcc-4.1 though as
the older versions have relatively random behavior.

One particular feature I'd like to use that requires a newer compiler is being
able to control warnings per function liker glibc does, using e.g.
 '_Pragma("GCC diagnostic disable \"-Woverride-init\"")'. Once we have that,
we could turn on a couple of additional warnings that are generally useful
but also warn about code that intentionally does something that would
trigger the warning.

I guess this means that even your builds require extra patches and you
can't strictly build a defconfig and expect that to work ;-)
