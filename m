My part of the story is easy to explain: the reason I skipped the 11/23 patch was 
because it was tagged 'kbuild' and because the commit that broke it was never 
acked by (or was upstreamed via) the x86 maintainers - we never upstreamed any 
modversions changes in the past AFAIR - so I assumed it would be handled via 
whatever path got the breakage upstream (turns out it was via the VFS tree?),
or via the kbuild tree.

Yeah, that was when my internal timer ran out: modversions breakage was reported 
against -rc1 already and it still wasn't working (a seemingly working kernel build 
resulted in an unbootable system) - due to the timeline and confusion you 
explained.

I totally agree with marking it BROKEN: it was the simplest, most robust way to 
fix it and nobody seemed to be owning the modversions feature.

Thanks,
