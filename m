Was there a conclusion to this discussion? I didn't see anything
definitive in the thread...

This appears to have support until July 31, 2018. (Though it's using a
2.6 kernel.)

This went fully unsupported on Feb 29, 2016.

This went fully unsupported on Apr 30, 2015.

General support ends Mar 31 2019, fully unsupported 31 Mar 2022. (And
like RHEL6 is using a 2.6 kernel.)

This needs gcc 4.5, with 4.7 preferred.

Introduced in gcc 4.9.

I'd be in support of raising the minimum to gcc 4.6. (I'd actually
prefer 4.7, just to avoid some 4.6 packaging issues, and for better
gcc plugin support.)

I'm curious what gcc 4.6 binaries are common in the wild besides
old-stable Debian (unsupported in maybe a year from now?) and 12.04
Ubuntu (going fully unsupported in 2 weeks). It looks like 4.6 was
used only in Fedora 15 and 16 (both EOL).
