Commit 9ccd608070b6 "arm64: dts: add device tree for ARM SMM-A53x2 on
LogicTile Express 20MG" added a new dts file to arch/arm64 which
included "../../../../arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi", i.e. a
.dtsi supplied by arch/arm.

Unfortunately this causes some issues for the split device tree
repository[0], since things get moved around there. In that context
the new .dts ends up at src/arm64/arm/vexpress-v2f-1xv7-ca53x2.dts
while the include is at src/arm/vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi.

The sharing of the .dtsi is legitimate since the baseboard is the same
for various vexpress systems whatever processor they use.

Previously I attempted to resolve this by creating a shared location
for such things but we have been unable to come to a consensus on
where that should be.

Instead this patch simply replaces the use of ../../ in the dts
/include/ with a symlink in arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm pointing to the
file arch/arm/boot/dts.

Since the split device tree repo will shortly be required to flatten
symlinks for other reasons this will cause the dtsi file to appear in
both src/arm and src/arm64 in the split repo, which is an improvement
on not building for arm64 now.
