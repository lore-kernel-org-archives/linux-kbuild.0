I very much agree here.  And in the end, what I really really want to
avoid is every distribution (or similar grouping of stuff) coming up
with N different ways to solve the problem of "how do I get the user
the right device tree to go with $whatever board they happen to be
running".  If the clever solution everyone comes up with is some other
container that's not FIT, that's fine, patches welcome and happily
reviewed for whatever the solution is.  I just don't want people
thinking this is a problem that hasn't been thought of before.
