Nicolas Pitre already suggested an impedance matcher that keeps this
kind of hacky code out of the kernel, and allows users to do exactly
that.  Daniel Mack took him up on the suggestion and implemented it [1].
I contributed some patches to make it work generically.

Please take a look.  Currently, the only outstanding blocker is to convert
atags to fdt.  Patches welcome as I'm currently occupied with other
things. ;-)

hth,

Jason.
