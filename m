One obvious benefit is the diff stat:

 25 files changed, 52 insertions(+), 557 deletions(-)


It is tedious to list generic-y for each arch
that needs it.

So, mandatory-y works like a fallback default
(by just wrapping asm-generic one)
when arch does not have a specific header implementation.

See the following commits:

def3f7cefe4e81c296090e1722a76551142c227c
a1b39bae16a62ce4aae02d958224f19316d98b24


It is tedious to convert headers one by one,
so I processed by a shell script.
