kallsyms is part of rodata, which is between .text and .init.text.
I understand this is intentional, and we already use two passes
of kallsyms to make sure the size is right. However the assumption
is that only the data of the kallsyms table changes between runs,
not the size of it.

It also seems to be a part of the design to do exactly two passes
and treat anything beyond that as bugs, doing it the way you
suggest would significantly increase the build time since the
kallsyms+linker stage cannot be done in parallel or sped up
using ccache.

Interesting point. No idea how often that happens. All the veneers
for one section are in one place though, so we could in theory
add a kallsyms entry for that section as long as can identify
it.

Right.

Sure I can rename it. Any suggestions?
