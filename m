The main benefit of keeping it per architecture and platform is that
it partitions the maintainer and review space a bit.

Right now it's not possible to do even per-arch "all-dtbs" since only
the currently configured platforms will get their dtbs compiled.

I believe this is currently still quite firmly in the "if" stage. :(

Ok, overlays might make sense if they can be made to work generically
enough and not be tied to expectations of the base board platform.

Still, even then I don't see dts as a core kernel feature (kernel/*),
lib/* might make more sense. And I don't want to see things like
vexpress stuff in there.

Yeah, there could potentially be some sharing between MIPS and
ARM{,64} too, but I don't know if we'll actually see it done.
