Okay, cool. I'll just do some simple tests with what I have so I can
feel like I understand its intended use, etc. :)

One change I made was to add this comment in compiler-gcc.h for people
that become curious about __nocapture and go looking for its
definition (please feel free to adjust for accuracy, etc):


/*
 * The initify gcc-plugin attempts to identify const arguments that are only
 * used during init (see __init), so they can be moved to the .init.rodata
 * section. If an argument is passed to a non-init function, it must
 * normally be assumed that such an argument has been captured by that
 * function and may be used in the future when .init has been unmapped from
 * memory. In order to identify functions that are confirmed to not capture
 * their arguments, the __nocapture() attribute is used so that initify can
 * better identify candidate variables.
 */
#ifdef INITIFY_PLUGIN
# define __nocapture(...) __attribute__((nocapture(__VA_ARGS__)))
#endif
