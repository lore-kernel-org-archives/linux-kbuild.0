mm, sounds good.

Sometimes I want to build allmodconfig-minus-debug options ... but not
all debug options.  I still want debugfs but most options that end with
_DEBUG are disabled.  I.e., I don't want the options that cause big
run-time slowdowns. (unless I cause that by printing some debugfs
contents)

Can merge_config.sh (or one of its cousins) help with that?

Ack.
