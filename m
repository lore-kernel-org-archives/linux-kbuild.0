Ok, and the reason is because even if we have a weak symbol from C, it
would always have a value.

Good to know what the heck the problem was.

Thanks. And I committed your "set to zero" patch, so we can hopefully
leave this all behind us.

I marked it for stable (not because older kernels need it, but because
it's the right thing to do and if we ever backport anything that
causes this we don't want to forget this).

And I'll keep the workaround in kernel/module.c just because it's
really late in the rc series, and I'd rather have both belt and
suspenders for this all right now.
