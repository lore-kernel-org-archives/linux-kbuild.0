And perhaps more constructively, we do need to prioritize address and data
dependencies over control dependencies.  For one thing, there are a lot
more address/data dependencies in existing code than there are control
dependencies, and (sadly, perhaps more importantly) there are a lot more
people who are convinced that address/data dependencies are important.

For another (admittedly more theoretical) thing, the OOTA scenarios
stemming from control dependencies are a lot less annoying than those
from address/data dependencies.

And address/data dependencies are as far as I know vulnerable to things
like conditional-move instructions that can cause problems for control
dependencies.

Nevertheless, yes, control dependencies also need attention.
