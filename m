Okay, I can't reproduce your bad linking times even with gc-sections. It's
possible I'm doing something wrong, but with my patches + your patch and
standard arm allyesconfig:

  20:33:56  AR      built-in.o
  20:33:57  LD      vmlinux.o
  MODPOST vmlinux.o
  20:34:12  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/generated/compile.h
  UPD     include/generated/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  AR      init/built-in.o
  20:34:24  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms1.o
  20:34:45  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms2.o
  20:34:54  LD      vmlinux
  20:35:07  SORTEX  vmlinux
  20:35:07  SYSMAP  System.map

I have about 71 seconds for the final link phase.

Command is:
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -j3 vmlinux

$ arm-linux-gnueabi-ld -v
GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.27

Confirming function/data sections:
$ objdump -h built-in.o | grep ^[[:space:]]*[0-9][0-9]* | wc -l
1012848

$ size vmlinux
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
74205771	36746855	19072744	130025370	7c0079a	vmlinux

$ file vmlinux
vmlinux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=37d207288f81f83291dfb45294a94c555d9fbdb8, not stripped

Final link command is:
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld -EL --no-fix-cortex-a8 -p --no-undefined -X --pic-veneer --build-id --gc-sections -X -o vmlinux -T ./arch/arm/kernel/vmlinux.lds --whole-archive built-in.o .tmp_kallsyms2.o

Which takes 12s

I'm building THUMB2 now, but if you have any hints for me...

Thanks,
Nick
