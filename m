I've not actually looked at the errata document - I need to jump through
all sorts of stupid hoops to get it through the ARM website.  Ever since
I requested a change of my email address, it now wants all sorts of
personal information that I'm refusing to type in again.  I've no idea
why ARM Ltd wiped out all that information just because I asked for my
email address to be changed.
