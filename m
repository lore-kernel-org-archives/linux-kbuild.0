Yes, thank you for the analysis and further discussion! I have done some
rudimentary printk debugging in QEMU and it looks like these are produce
the same value:

__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt
&__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt
&__start___trace_bprintk_fmt[0]

as well as

__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt != __start___trace_bprintk_fmt
&__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt != &__start___trace_bprintk_fmt
&__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt[0] != &__start___trace_bprintk_fmt[0]

I'll use the second one once I confirm this is true in all callspots
with both Clang and GCC, since it looks cleaner. Let me know if there
are any objections to that.

Cheers,
Nathan
