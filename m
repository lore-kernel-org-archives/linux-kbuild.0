Hi everyone,

apologies for picking up a topic that's more than 360 days old...

We're in the position where we'd like to have FDT support just because 
it simplifies our code a whole lot; yet we want to be able to run such a 
kernel on older u-boots (completely unaware of FTDs) as well.
I believe this must be a very common use case indeed.
So a dtbuImage.<dtb> would be very useful in this case.

If I understand it correctly, dtbImage.<dtb> is indeed just a cat of 
zImage+dtb, whereas dtbuImage.<dtb> is the uimage of such a dtbImage.<dtb>.
So it shouldn't be such a crazy idea to create a dtbuImage.<dtb> within 
Kbuild (as opposed to from an external wrapper for make).

Is there any reason why nothing like that was ever mainlined?
Or maybe I'm just missing something?

Thanks!
Gerlando
