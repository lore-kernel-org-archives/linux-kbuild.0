No definite answer, no. My personal view now is that we should probably
merge the patches I sent, to help those that for one reason or another
use one of those ancient toolchains, but we should not go actively looking
for more problems with those compilers.

Thanks for looking these up. This means we need to consider how important
build testing on SLES11 is to us in the long run. The most important scenario
I can think of for anyone would be someone that maintains an embedded
system with an x86 CPU and uses a SLES11 setup to maintain their
own distro.

In this case you typically don't want to modify your environment, but
one might want to upgrade the target kernel, and would suffer if
we break that.

I think we are better off defining two versions: One that we know
a lot of people care about, and we actively try to make that work
well in all configurations (e.g. 4.6, 4.7 or 4.8), fixing all warnings
we run into, and an older version that we try not to break
intentionally (e.g. 3.4, 4.1 or 4.3) but that we only fix when
someone actually runs into a problem they can't work around
by upgrading to a more modern compiler.
