This looks nicer. I like variant B because it keeps the GENKSYMS cruft to
a single location, but either one isn't too bad.

I'd like to get moving on this, so let's at least get the generic kbuild
change merged. In the end, the kbuild code does not prevent a maintainer
from putting their EXPORT_SYMBOL in whatever location they like, so there
is no reason not to merge it (certainly there will be archs that do use
it).

Michal, what's your thoughts? If you merge my patch 2/2 and skip 1/2, it
should not give any new build warnings or errors, so then arch patches can
go via arch trees. 1/2 could go in after everyone is up to date.

Thanks,
Nick
