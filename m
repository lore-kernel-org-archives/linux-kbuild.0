As an example, let us consider __ktime_get_fast_ns(), the critical bit
is:

		seq = raw_read_seqcount_latch(&tkf->seq);
		tkr = tkf->base + (seq & 0x01);
		now = tkr->base;

And we hard rely on that being a dependent load, so:

  LOAD	seq, (tkf->seq)
  LOAD  tkr, tkf->base
  AND   seq, 1
  MUL   seq, sizeof(tk_read_base)
  ADD	tkr, seq
  LOAD  now, (tkr->base)

Such that we obtain 'now' as a direct dependency on 'seq'. This ensures
the loads are ordered.

A compiler can wreck this by translating it into something like:

  LOAD	seq, (tkf->seq)
  LOAD  tkr, tkf->base
  AND   seq, 1
  CMP	seq, 0
  JE	1f
  ADD	tkr, sizeof(tk_read_base)
1:
  LOAD  now, (tkr->base)

Because now the machine can speculate and load now before seq, breaking
the ordering.
