First, thanks for taking care of this! Sorry for the delay in replying, I've been
having trouble recently with my email client not showing up new messages in subfolders...

Now, unfortunately, I had already tried this solution (I think almost exactly this
patch in fact), and it does not work. I confirmed this just now by applying the patch
on master and compiling from a clean tree. The compilation of signal.c failed with:

 > In file included from ../arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:36:0:
 > ../arch/arm64/include/asm/vdso.h:30:36: fatal error: generated/vdso-offsets.h: No
such file or directory
 >  #include <generated/vdso-offsets.h>

Note that I compile with 40 threads (make -j40), and that's the core of the problem.
Indeed, by adding the forced dependency on
$(objtree)/include/generated/vdso-offsets.h in kernel/Makefile, you say that the
recipe must always be run, but you don't say that it has to be run before any other
*.c file in the directory is compiled. When compiling with a single thread (or maybe
only a small number), this happens to work because the Makefile is executed more or
less sequentially, but with a bigger number of threads it breaks quite easily.

Therefore, please do not merge this patch, it can break the compilation quite easily.

Back to the problem, I think I haven't been clear enough: there is _no way_ with
Kbuild to ensure that a header is generated before its sources are compiled, using
only normal Makefile dependencies. We _must_ generate the header before recursing
into any Makefile that compiles files depending on this header. Assuming that we have
no choice but to keep this vdso-offsets.h header, there is no way around modifying
arm64/Makefile to ensure that it is generated first.

To reply to your concern about my patch:

 > This indeed looks dodgy. I'm not sure about the makefile rules but would the above
override the "prepare" target in the top Makefile?

Rules are cumulative, they do not override each other. I am only making
"vdso_prepare" an additional prerequisite of "prepare", with "vdso_prepare" depending
on "prepare0" to ensure that asm-offsets.h is generated first. What is dodgy is that
we are not supposed to add prerequisites to "prepare" in arch Makefiles, but again, I
don't see how we can avoid doing that here. It seems to me that this is an oversight
in the top-level Makefile, and I don't think that adding a prerequisite to "prepare"
is unreasonable.

Thanks,
Kevin
