That's what it *seems* like. I wanted to be conservative because I don't
know the architecture nor have actually looked at the errata docs. You
can probably make stronger guarantees to avoid it. Perhaps enabling just
for modules would be workable.

It looks like it would be a bit of work to go that route. The linker of
course would not give you relocations or stubs for the branches you
need them.

Anyway do what you think best with the patch. It seems to eliminate the
link time regression on ARM allyesconfig when using thin archives for
building which is the main thing I was concerned about.

Thanks,
Nick
