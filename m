This really seems way too complicated for this situation.

And it's wrong too. The whole point of modversions was that you didn't
want to do the full version check.

We already know there were *some* crc's (we checked that at the top of
check_version(), but we've also checked it in "same_magic()" - it's
what makes us ignore the exact version number), but this particular
symbol doesn't have a crc. Just let it through, because we have bugs
in binutils.

So your extra complexity logic seems actively wrong. It makes
MODVERSIONS not work at all, rather than limp along. You're better off
just not having MODVERSIONS.
