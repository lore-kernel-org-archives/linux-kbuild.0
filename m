thanks.. the explosions you get with these mistakes when building
drivers as modules in a distro kernel config are quite "fun" to
debug..

I'm not quite sure about the rules for whether merging this would
count as a regression, but I would argue those drivers are already
broken, just no one noticed yet.  Similar to when a new gcc gets more
clever about detecting bugs.  So I wouldn't be against merging this
first to force drivers to fix their crap ;-)
