Linus added -Wno-maybe-uninitialized a while ago, and I think only gcc-4.8
and higher were affected by that, as earlier versions only understand
-Wuninitialized (meaning both "definitely uninitialized" and "might be
uninitialized". The latest state is that gcc-4.9 enables all uninitialized
warnings and I try to fix them for all known compilers, gcc-4.8
disables -Wmaybe-uninitialized unless you build with "make W=2".

On gcc-4.9 and higher, we also don't enable -Wmaybe-unintialized when
certain configuration options are set that cause extra false positives,
but it's still enabled with W=2.

I actually think it would be a good idea to also disable -Wuninitialized
for gcc-4.7 and earlier unless you ask for W2. That would get us
much closer to a clean build, but still give you the chance to see the
warnings if you really want to.

I see this one until gcc-4.8 if I build with W=2 to turn the warning back on.

Also here: I see the warning on ARM with all versions from gcc-4.1 through
4.8 (with W=1), but not any higher versions including 7.0.1. If I mark
fsl_lpspi_transfer_one as 'noinline', I see it on all versions, which is a bit
odd. It might be worth opening a gcc bug report for that. I tried the
'noinline' as I suspected gcc might be smart enough to figure out that
the list is never empty, but I later noticed that it has no way of knowing
that even without the 'noinline' flag.

I've tested all the architectures I mentioned earlier that were around 10
years ago (aside from ia64, I could not build gcc successfully) with
linux-4.3 (arbitrarily picked, this was the version in which x86 and mips
no longer built with gcc-4.1), and built a defconfig with both gcc-4.9
(which I had around from earlier testing) and with gcc-4.1/4.3:

          gcc-4.1  gcc-4.3  gcc-4.9
alpha  failed    success success
arm    failed     success success
cris     failed     success success
frv       failed     failed    success
m32r  success success success
m68k  success success success
mips   failed     failed     success
parisc success success success
powerpc failed failed    success
s390    failed    failed    success
sh        failed    success success
x86      failed    success success

I'd conclude that nobody aside from you sends bugfixes for 4.1,
or has done so in a while. I have the logs available if you want,
but there isn't really much surprising: we get the same link error
as on mips and x86 on some additional architectures, powerpc
and s390 use features that weren't available and frv hits an ICE.

We could define the minimum compiler to be gcc-4.3 on all architectures
except m68k (and possibly parisc, certainly nobody cares about
m32r enough), where it would be gcc-4.1, to reflect what is actually
already the case.
