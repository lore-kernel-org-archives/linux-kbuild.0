I agree.

Another new way this patch added is,

 CONFIG options are now described in the ReST document,
 but our current way is to describe the detailed information
 in the 'help' section in Kconfig files.

Indeed.  The file format is too specific for his purpose;
'Negative side effect level' is a key word
that must be placed 3 lines below the CONFIG entry.
