I'm surprised the commit message and the provided documentation say
nothing about using CHECK=foo on the command line. That already supports
arbitrary checkers. How does this relate to that? Is this supposed to be
a complete replacement? Or what?

'make help' also references $CHECK, and this patch doesn't update the
help text.

Please get rid of runchecks_help.txt and use the usual python mechanisms
to specify and parse command line options, with their help texts,
including automated --help output. This keeps the implementation and the
help together, with hopes they'll actually stay in sync. Please don't
hand roll argument parsers in python.

> +
> +Options:
> +  -h|--help	List this text
> +  --list	List the different configured checkers and the list of interpreted check
> +		types for each of them.
> +  --		Separator between parameters to runchecks and compiler parameters to be
> +		passed directly to the checkers.
> +  --run:[checker1[,checker2..]|all]
> +		Override the default set of checkers to be run for each source file. By
> +		default the checkers to run will be the intersection of the checkers
> +		configured by ``run`` commands in the configuration file and the
> +		checkers that is actually available on the machine. Use 'all'
> +		to run all the configured checkers.
> +  --color	Use coloring in the error and warning output. In this mode
> +		output from checkers that are supported by typedefs but not
> +		captured by any such will be highlighted in red to make it
> +		easy to detect that a typedef rule is missing. See -t below.
> +  -f		Force mode: force runchecks to run a full run in directories/trees
> +		where runchecks does not find a	runchecks.cfg file. The default
> +		behaviour is to skip running checkers in directories/trees
> +		where no matching runchecks.cfg file is found either in the
> +		source file directory or above.
> +  -n		Ignore all runchecks.cfg files except the one in scripts,
> +		which are used for basic runchecks configuration. This allows
> +		an easy way to run a "bare" version of checking where all
> +		issues are reported, even those intended to be suppressed.
> +		Implicitly enables force mode.
> +  -w		Behave as if 0 on exit from all checkers. Normally
> +		runchecks will fail on the first checker to produce errors or
> +		warnings, in fact anything that produces not suppressed
> +		output on stderr. This is to make it easy to work interactively,
> +		avoiding overlooking anything, but sometimes it is useful to
> +		be able to produce a full report of status.
> +  -t		Typedef setup mode: For checkers where runchecks enable typedefs:
> +		Behaves as -w except for stderr output that is not captured
> +		by any typedefs. This is a convenience mode while
> +		fixing/improving typedef setup. Use with --color to get red
> +		output for the statements to capture with new typedefs.
> +  -v		Verbose output. Also enabled if called from make with V=1,
> +		but it is useful to be able to only enable verbose mode for runchecks.
> +  -d		Debugging output - more verbose.
