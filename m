As I understand it, genksyms incorporates the definitions of a
function's parameter and return types - not just their names - and all
the types they refer to, recursively.  So a structure size change
should change the version of all functions where the function and its
caller pass that structure between them, however indirectly.  It finds
such indirect ABI breakage for me fairly regularly, though of course I
don't know that it finds everything.

That's fine for individual functions.

Where there is a family of driver modules (e.g. foo-core, foo-pci, foo-
usb), a structure change can change all exports from foo-core.  That
ABI is of no use to out-of-tree drivers so we don't care about keeping
it stable, but we do care about preventing an accidental mismatch.

Since the kernel does the symbol lookup and version matching,=C2=A0I'm not
sure what userland can do about it.
