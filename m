We haven't run into any bugs AFAIK. It's been pretty solid.

*thin* archives does require binutils 2.19. That's nearly 10 years
old, but we advertise 2.12 minimum at the moment. We'd have make "T"
an optional argument if we turn it on unconditionally. Regular
archives shouldn't be significantly worse than ld -r though, so yeah
maybe we could do that.

powerpc required a build fix:

43c9127d94d

-override AR    := GNUTARGET=elf$(BITS)-$(GNUTARGET) $(AR)
+KBUILD_ARFLAGS += --target=elf$(BITS)-$(GNUTARGET)

So there could be a couple of small things like this.

Thanks,
Nick
