Well, the good news is that pretty fundamentally, if it's just the asm
symbls, those really don't have ABI's that change (or if they change,
it's such a fundamental change that everything else will likely have
changed too and we don't need to worry about one asm symbol crc - the
change will be caught by other symbols).

So I think the whole "we don't really care" approach should work fine.
The "let's make every symbol always be versioned" may just be too much
pain for no real gain.
