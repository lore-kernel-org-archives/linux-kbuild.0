It this min gcc thingy ARM only?
The current minimium (documented) is gcc v3.2. With the -fno-PIE patches
I was going to raise the bar to at least v3.4 but did not get around to
it yet. hpa said that everything < 3.4 is broken on x86 [0].
Gert is getting code compiled on gcc v4.1 not sure if it is some kind of
gcc limitation or just for fun.
Unless people are stuck with some enterprise distro I don't see a reason
why one should not try a gcc-4.6 which is 5 years old. I had problems to
verify that the current kernel compiles with gcc v3.2 on x86 (it did
with a bunch of warnings with gcc 3.4 and booted).
