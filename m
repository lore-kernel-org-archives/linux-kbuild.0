Yes.

Those are usually located in special sections, like the initcall table, 
the CPU entry table, etc. The linker allows for those sections to be 
marked with KEEP() not to prune them.

It doesn't interfere with inlining. However it impose a section 
alignment on every function. That still can be overriden though. Also, I 
suppose that gcc may not assume that calls to a global function that 
happens to be located in the same C file will be close by anymore, 
however I don't see this having any impact on ARM code generation.
