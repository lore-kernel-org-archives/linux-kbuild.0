Sorry about that - we have a buildroot based distro about to be pushed upstream -
that would make it easier.

Indeed it does - I fell stupid why this didn't occur to me. But given that you
have dealt with the dtb Makefile stuff alot more than I have :-) do you know why
it was not working when put in Makefile.lib because I feel a few other arches also
suffer from the same issue and would need similar fixes.

Anyhow, for the patch, I can manually add --author="you" but it'll still lack your
SOB - you OK with that or do you want to send a formal patch.

Thx,
