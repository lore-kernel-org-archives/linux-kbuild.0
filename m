Normally, recordmcount ignores each ftrace.o file, but since we are
running it on vmlinux.o, we need another way to stop it from looking
at references to mcount/fentry that are not calls. Here's a comment
from recordmcount.c:

  /*
   * The file kernel/trace/ftrace.o references the mcount
   * function but does not call it. Since ftrace.o should
   * not be traced anyway, we just skip it.
   */

But I agree, the commit message could use more defails. Also +Steven
for thoughts about this approach.
