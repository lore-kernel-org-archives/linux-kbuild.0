The problematic merge was 84d6984 (it brought in 22823ab4^..590abbdd).
Interesting commits have "$ARCH: move exports to definitions" in their
subjects, they indeed did not go through arch trees.

Per Ben Hutchings' objection, it doesn't look like BROKEN is an option at
least for 4.9 -- even if mainline leaves it as is, distro maintainers would
need to do the work themselves.

Architectures that look like they could be affected:
    x86 alpha m68k s390 arm ppc sparc ia64
(this list might be incomplete!).

Of these, ppc and arm are already fixed, x86 is in this thread,
arm64 is not on the list which explains why it works for me.  No idea about
the rest.
