I don't think so, there are many usecases for FIT and cleanly
embedding DTBs is a common usecase, (along with stronger checksums,
compression). That is also the basis of my ELC talk tomorrow morning
;-)
You could peruse the slides at, http://wwwelinux.org/Fit-boot to get a
better understanding of what FIT solves. With the move to
multiplatform kernels, it is quite a logical next step to add this
support to the kernel build.

As for pulling additional tools, dtc is already a part of the kernel
so the idea is to use existing tools.

FIT doesnt need any such bootloader variables and thus benefits from
the simplicity.

For these boards, we can special case to doing a non-fit boot to keep
them backward-compatibility. I don't think maintaining
backward-compatibility requires any additional work, but just building
the kernel with a different make target.
