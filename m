It's not (or was not) a bug exactly - it was something introduced in commit
10b63956fce7f369cc37fd4d994f09bd5203efe4 to ease the transition to using the
UAPI headers as Linus required the commit for each header dir to go through
the submaintainer's tree.

It was supposed to be removed, but that never got posted to Linus because t=
he
next phase of cleanups didn't happen as Linus said he block my email and ne=
ver
take any more patches from me if I sent him any more:-/
