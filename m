That kind of name clash should hardly be an issue, in comparison with the
care it requires to merge fixes on top of a backport which has already
changed ABI. It tends to be trivially fixable just by search/replace
in the patchfile before applying, if nothing else. But you probably *want*
to be flagged on those things and merge by hand anyway.

Backporting alone I don't think can justify symbol versioning, but I'd
like to hear from distro maintainers if any disagree.

Thanks,
