Hmm.

The main kernel image is guaranteed to be contiguous in physical memory
for all sorts of reasons, so this really isn't a concern for the kernel
itself.

Modules, however, are a different matter, as they are mapped in using
individual pages, and are most likely to be non-contiguous in physical
memory.  The kernel's module linker knows nothing about this errata,
so it'll generally just fix up the relocations in the most basic of
ways.

So, I think we should always use this --no-fix-cortex-a8 option where
the linker supports it irrespective of whether we're running on a core
needing this workaround, but we probably need to fix the kernel module
linker to know about this.
