 From my point of view, it is. We need to allow changing ABI for some 
modules while maintaining it for others.
In fact I think that there should be version not only for every exported 
symbol (in the EXPORT_SYMBOL() sense), but also for every public type 
(in the sense of eg. structure defined in the public header file).

Thanks,
