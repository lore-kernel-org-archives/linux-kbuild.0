Fair enough.

Mostly the "may be used uninitialized" warnings. I believe they were disabled
in gcc-4.3 (4.2?) and later due to too many false positives, which is not an
issue for me, as I look at differences.
They were re-enabled lately (with much less false-positives), that's why you
see them, and fix them.

For example, do you see the warning fixed by commit 1b8c1012142d8322
("drivers: net: xgene: Simplify xgene_enet_setup_mss() to kill warning")
with gcc-4.3? Yes, that was a false positive.

Or see commit cc4a7ffe02c95f53 ("spi: fsl-lpspi: Pre-initialize ret in
fsl_lpspi_transfer_one_msg()"). That one was a real bug.

I don't see that in any of the kisskb build logs, and they use gcc-4.2.4 for
avr32. So having gcc-4.2 or gcc-4.3 in a farm won't help.

And as long as I find real bugs this way, I'd like to continue doing it.

No sane people enable GFS in defconfig, so it's not affected.

Oh wait, some mips, powerpc, s390, and tile do ;-)
