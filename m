Stephen,

The hack has come to bite us after all, with Nick's proposed change to
CONFIG_THIN_ARCHIVES for all architectures, the entire lib.a file will
end up being linked into each kernel that enables the directory.

I'm out of other ideas for fixing it, so it seems better to revert back to
individual Kconfig options. Once we enable
CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION (which is the
next step after CONFIG_THIN_ARCHIVES), we can simply list
all files, and the linker will drop all unused functions by itself.
