So, I don't think it's needed for the first version of this, but it'd
be nice to have a way for end users to discover _why_ some option they
want is unavailable. Having them dig through the Kconfigs, edit
scripts to see stderr again, running those by hand, etc, is really
unfriendly. If, instead, stderr was visible from the menuconfig "help"
for a Kconfig, it could serve as automatic documentation for why
something wasn't enabled. I don't mean for stderr to get sprayed out
during a regular "make"; I agree: that would be ugly and pointless.
I'd just like some way for the reason behind an option being disabled
to be discoverable in some way.
