Okay, but existing modversions AFAIKS does not solve your problems described
in yor your earlier mail either. Modversions hardly catches ABI breakage at
all, you can't rely on it that way. It's far more likely that some structure
size changes deep in the kernel than an exported function type signature
changes.

I'm not sure how you know which exports are used only by in-tree modules
and which are used out of tree, but if you know that then you can version
them manually as we said by adding _v2 in the rare case you need to change
a behaviour.

So I'm still having trouble understanding what modversions is giving you.

I don't think people are adverse to carrying some upstream complexity for
ditsros. Although for this fancy blacklist case, can it just be done in
userspace?

Thanks,
