Hi Michal,

I ended up deciding to do a v3, because I had several changes
accumulated, as described in patches.

I've also left off the powerpc arch patches -- they can be found
in previous posts, for reference.

I've again tested ARM and it seems to be building okay and without
performance regression with my configurations. I think it's going
to be a matter of some toolchain options for them to go through.
arm64, x86, powerpc, and arm for me all built fine with thin archives
and --gc-sections enabled, so I can't see there being a fundamental
issue that can't be solved. Worst case, the incremental link option
can remain for a time.

Thanks,
Nick
