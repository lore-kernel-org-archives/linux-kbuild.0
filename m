New way is you put the EXPORT_SYMBOL in the .S file, and give it a C
style prototype in asm-prototypes.h, and that's it. The build system
will do the rest. Either way you require some file of C prototypes,
but after Al's patches, at least the EXPORT goes with its definition.

As far as rebuilding too often, that sounds like a bug, more below.

For the patches that touched arm code, I'd agree you should have been cc'ed.

Not to dismiss that concern at all, but for issues of interest to arch code
but not specific to any (such as discovery that the asm exports change would
require this change to restore CRC generation), I was just saying linux-arch
is most appropriate for better or worse. Ccing 30 arch lists is not workable.

And again not to dismiss your concern, I'm just here trying to come up with
a workable fix for the non-revert scenario. Revert is no less valid an
option, it's just not one I'm in favour of myself.

Good catch, I'm surprised you're the first one who reported it. This patch
seems to do the trick for me:
