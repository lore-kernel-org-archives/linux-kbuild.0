adding a modules.builtin.alias with the same format of modules.alias
means during modprobe we would only need to load one more file to
lookup aliases. That doesn't mean the kernel built system should do it
though. The same way it's depmod job to create the
modules.alias{,.bin}, we could leave this to depmod if it's in fact
useful to split the information.

I think your version is simple enough and we would get more
information that would be useful for modinfo.
It would indeed be nice to output something useful in  "modinfo ext4".

In kmod, I think we would create modules.builtin.modinfo{,.bin} and
just add the aliases to modules.alias{,.bin},
This would keep the names consistent with what is already there.
