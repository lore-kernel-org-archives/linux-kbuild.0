Is this including these changes now in the kbuild tree?

I can take a look at ARM and try to get it at least to parity with
incremental link. Any particular config options required?

Well the current proposal is to unconditionally enable it for all archs
for 4.13. After that I'll submit patches to x86 and powerpc arch
maintainers to allow LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION as an option. I guess
you will do ARM and there have been MIPS guys looking at it too.

That leaves a window of one release. ARM could unselect thin archives if
necessary but I think it would be much better to enable it and flush out
any toolchain and build issues before doing the LD_DCDE option. Disabling
should be a last resort if we can't fix something in time for release.

Thanks,
Nick
