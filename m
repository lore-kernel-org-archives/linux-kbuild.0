I've tried to get to the bottom of this, but couldn't find anything
related to the toolchain version. I've tried binutils 2.23, 2.24, 2.26
and 2.27, and also gcc-7.0, gcc-5.4.1 and gcc-4.9.3, but with today's
linux-next, I always get

Out of 12 randconfig builds that had CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled, all 12
had this problem, though not always with all the symbols.
