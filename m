Sometimes people ask about kernel hardening features, that's the
reason why the KSPP's list and the kconfig-hardened-check script were
written.
Unfortunately, kernel features with security implications have often
misleading names and descriptions and are scattered around the
menuconfig.
This patchset will help anyone who want to have an "hardened kernel"
but isn't following kernel development closely enough to know about
all the features.
On one hand, this will provide an official and understandable list of
hardening features inside the kernel doc, on the other hand it also
provide a fast and easy way to enable those features all at once.

The reason why I'm doing it like this is that I want both the config
fragments and the doc in the kernel.
Generating the fragments from the doc is the best way to make sure
that they will always do what the doc says.

I don't know if maintainers of the other fragments care at all about
having every single option documented in detail.
For hardening features it makes sense, because people may want to just
learn about them and enable them manually.
I don't know if this is common or desirable for other config fragments.

Thank you for you comment,
