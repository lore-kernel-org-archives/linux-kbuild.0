Dereferencing a _Dependent_ptr pointer gives you something that is not
_Dependent_ptr, unless the declaration was like this:

	_Dependent_ptr _Atomic (TYPE) * _Dependent_ptr a;

And if I recall correctly, the current state is that assigning a
_Dependent_ptr variable to a non-_Dependent_ptr variable strips this
marking (though the thought was to be able to ask for a warning).

So, yes, it would be nice to be able to explicitly strip the
_Dependent_ptr, perhaps the kill_dependency() macro, which is already
in the C standard.

Fair point, and in C++ this is a templated class, at least in the same
sense that std::atomic<> is a templated class.

But in this case, would kill_dependency do what you want?
