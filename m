I'm not sure being contiguous matters much - looking at the errata doc,
the implication is that the branch is supposed to use bits 31:12 of the
address of the first page, but under the erratum conditions ends up
taking bits 31:12 of the address of the _second_ page instead. There
doesn't seem to be any importance of where those pages actually are
relative to each other.

Given the above, I'm not convinced that sounds safe, but then I can't
claim to have fist-hand experience with this bug either.
