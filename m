This is about what I saw.

The info here isn't very good because KSYM is printed after the link
but before the kallsyms generation. We can kind of see what's happening
if we take the time between the KSYM and the LD vmlinux as the time for
kallsyms: 
                           before    after
KSYM                      ~12s      ~12s
LD      vmlinux.o          20s       18s
LD      .tmp_kallsyms1.o   28s        8s
LD      .tmp_kallsyms2.o   33s        7s
LD      vmlinux            33s        8s

Probably the cortex a8 workaround does not get applied to vmlinux.o
link (due to being incremental), so we don't see any speedup with the
patch. It takes longer overall I guess because it keeps a lot of
symbols in the output file (due to incremental).

Thanks, I'll take a look.
