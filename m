I have no good idea for the syntax and I and not sure what is gained
by reducing a driver with one file.
Agreed - simple drivers would then be a single file - and thats a good argument.

If it makes sense to group stuff inside a menuconfig it would
also make sense to put the same modules in a subdirectory.
And then we would have the menuconfig in the Kconfig
file that would source the others.

So I do not see this as an issue for the 'embedded' syntax described above.
