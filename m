Yeah that's true, and as I realized a distro can rename a symbol if they
make incompatible changes which happens very rarely. Avoids having to
carry some whole infrastructure upstream for it.

That sounds good. Should we try to get 4.9 working (which we could
do relatively easily with a few arch reverts), and then disable
modversions for 4.10? (at which point we can un-revert Al's arch
patches)
