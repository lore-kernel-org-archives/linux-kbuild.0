Hi Nick,

I won't disagree with you there. :-)

modversions is a pretty heavy handed approach that basically says if all the
symbols and types haven't changed for a given EXPORT_SYMBOL (recursively
checked), then there is a high degree of confidence the OOT driver will not
only load, but run correctly.

The question is how to provide a similar guarantee if a different way?

We have plenty of customers with 10 year old drivers, where the expertise
has long left the company.  The engineers still around, recompile and make
tweaks to get things working on the latest RHEL.  Verify it passes testing
and release it.  Then they hope to not touch it again for a few years until
the next RHEL comes along.

Scary, huh? :-)

Common examples, filesystems and storage drivers.


There is no way that I see to provide a 100% guarantee, but if we do enough
checks, we should be able to have a high degree of confidence the driver
won't blow up.

On the flip side, easy things in the kernel to do is:

- provide the memory allocation (instead of having the driver staticly
  allocate)
- provide functions to retrieve various internal data (instead of having the
  driver do direct referencing to deep internal elements)
- cut down on some static inlines (and use accessory functions instead),
  etc.

Those types of changes allow the OOT driver to be more ignorant of kernel
changes and struct modifications.


Look to Stanislav's responses for his ideas on new tooling.

Thanks for helping!

Cheers,
Don
