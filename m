If the "address" is never dereferenced, but only used for arithmetic
(in a way that the the pointed to type is irrelevant), does the
pointed to type matter?  I don't feel strongly either way, but we seem
to have found two additional possible solutions for these warnings,
which is my ultimate goal. Nathan, hopefully those are some ideas you
can work with to address the additional cases throughout the kernel?
