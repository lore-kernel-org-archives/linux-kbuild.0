Sure, but this has nothing to do with policy regarding the HW. This is
entirely to do with the build environment of the DTB, which in general
you don't need to know.

That's only useful if you have access to the machine that the source is
on, access to the repo on said machine, and so on.

You can easily slightly modify a DTB by decompiling and recompiling it,
as bootloaders do to inject /chosen/bootargs. Admittedly this can be
painful, but at least you know exactly what was changed, because you
know which DTB you started with.

Consider what modification by other agents means for provenance of the
DTB. We've already been bitten by bootloaders messing with the DTB [1],
and simple loaders can change things substantially [2,3], and won't
update any provenance binding.

You can already check the hash if you want to check that you copies the
correct version; which is better than trusting an arbitrary string,
because if anything fiddles with the DTB it will change.

One could also build the same DTB from two different dts files, no?

You could build the same dtb from the same dts, but with some arbitrary
things changed, such that the at either end of the process is
irrelevant. Personally, I end up doing this a fair amount when testing.

Except that the absolute path is realtive to the machine it was built
on, so doesn't actually help.

On various machines I have folders called /home/mark/src/linux. These
are not the same folder. If I gave you a DTB that told you it was from
/home/mark/src/linux/arch/arm64/boot/dts/vendor/foo.dts, you would have
difficulty acquiring that precise file.

As far as I can tell, this binding just allows you to place a
meaningless set of strings in the DTB, that don't actually tell you
anything useful.

Mark.
