That we are not generating modversions for the asm exports is a known
problem, independent of the toolchain. The problem with some toolchains
(presumably, because that's the next thing to blame if the source and
the .config is identical) is that the CRCs do not appear as 0 in the
___kcrctab/___kcrctab_gpl section.
