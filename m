I grabbed this patch and applied it to the kbuid/thin-ac tree. I tested
with thin archives enabled and disabled with arm defconfig which ends up
setting CONFIG_SUNXI_CCU=y.

The patch makes no difference to vmlinux size whether using traditional
incremental link, or thin archives (there is a small difference between
inclink and thinarc but that's unrelated).

So this thin archives change does not break your patch, it's just that
it doesn't really do the right thing. I like the general idea, but we
need to work out how to make it properly supported by the build system.

With the patch applied, this is what the build system currently does:

arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld -EL    -r -o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/built-in.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun5i.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun6i-a31.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun8i-a23.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun8i-a33.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun8i-h3.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun8i-v3s.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun8i-r.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun9i-a80.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun9i-a80-de.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun9i-a80-usb.o drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/lib.a drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/lib-ksyms.o

This incremental link pulls in all your lib.a objects and links them
into built-in.o. They can no longer be selectively linked.

Thanks,
Nick
