agreed.

A new version is understandable. But why is an old version required?
One thing is an enterprise distro that is "current" or "supported" and still
stuck with gcc 4.1 because that is the version they decided to include in
their release. This is sad. But you might want to ask yourself why you want
the latest kernel but an old gcc / binutils.

If you have an architecture that compiles with gcc v4.1 and not with gcc
latest stable / trunk then it is a sign that this port is not supported
properly / not heatly. One thing is something like avr32 which is not part of
upstream gcc due to some legal reason (that was my understanding a few years
ago). It might get to a problem for them once large parts of userland switch
to a later C++ standard which is gcc-5+.
