Subject: [PATCH RESEND] arm64: fix vdso-offsets.h dependency
Date: Thu, 12 May 2016 17:39:15 +0100

arm64/kernel/{vdso,signal}.c include vdso-offsets.h, as well as any
file that includes asm/vdso.h. Therefore, vdso-offsets.h must be
generated before these files are compiled.

The current rules in arm64/kernel/Makefile do not actually enforce
this, because even though $(obj)/vdso is listed as a prerequisite for
vdso-offsets.h, this does not result in the intended effect of
building the vdso subdirectory (before all the other objects). As a
consequence, depending on the order in which the rules are followed,
vdso-offsets.h is updated or not before arm64/kernel/{vdso,signal}.o
are built. The current rules also impose an unnecessary dependency on
vdso-offsets.h for all arm64/kernel/*.o, resulting in unnecessary
rebuilds. This is made obvious when using make -j:

  touch arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/gettimeofday.S && make -j$NCPUS arch/arm64/kernel

will sometimes result in none of arm64/kernel/*.o being
rebuilt, sometimes all of them, or even just some of them.

It is quite difficult to ensure that a header is generated before it
is used with recursive Makefiles by using normal rules.  Instead,
arch-specific generated headers are normally built in the archprepare
recipe in the arch Makefile (see for instance arch/ia64/Makefile).
Unfortunately, asm-offsets.h is included in gettimeofday.S, and must
therefore be generated before vdso-offsets.h, which is not the case if
archprepare is used. For this reason, a rule run after archprepare has
to be used.

This commit adds rules in arm64/Makefile to build vdso-offsets.h
during the prepare step, ensuring that vdso-offsets.h is generated
before building anything. It also removes the now-unnecessary
dependencies on vdso-offsets.h in arm64/kernel/Makefile. Finally, it
removes the duplication of asm-offsets.h between arm64/kernel/vdso/
and include/generated/ and makes include/generated/vdso-offsets.h a
target in arm64/kernel/vdso/Makefile.

Resending with linux-kbuild in cc, hopefully some people there will have
an opinion on this.

I am not completely satisfied with the fix, since it uses a hack with
the prepare and prepare0 rules that should not be used in arch
Makefiles. However, all of my other attempts (including explicit
dependencies on gettimeofday.S, etc. in arm64/kernel/Makefile) failed
in some way. Hopefully, a Makefile wizard will come up with a better
solution.
