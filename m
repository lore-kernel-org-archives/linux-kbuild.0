Some kind of option like this could be a good idea. It could apply
to any kind of link-time optimization we do. I'll think about it.

Yes, I shouldn't have confused the terms. gc-sections is a trivial
form of LTO, but not "LTO".

I agree after it starts getting implemented and debugged by small
system users, we could make it default in the interest of sharing
testing and reducing combinations.
