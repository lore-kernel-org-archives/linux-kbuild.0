In general this feature will be useful for all those people who are
interested in enabling hardening features on their kernel.
Maybe they are not so many, but they exist and are the reason why
KSPP's list and kconfig-hardened-check script were written.
Anyway, not everybody is willing to trade a lot of performance for security.
I hope that splitting features based on their negative impact will
increase the usage of those features which are more "usable", but
still not so known by many people.

Good, I can add myself as maintainer, I also got Kees permission to
add him as designated reviewer too.

Yes, this approach is a bit "original". I think your suggestions are sensible.
I'll document better the format and add more checks to the script to
make it more resilient.

The reason why everything starts from an .rst is that I'd like to have
a doc page with a detailed list of all the hardening feature.
If the fragments aren't going to be generated from the doc we'll a way
to make sure that what is written in the doc is coherent with what
Kconfig is doing.
I'm don't think that it will be much better.

This seems reasonable, I'll change it.

Thank you for your time,
