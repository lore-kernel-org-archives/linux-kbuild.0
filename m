Naming is often the most difficult thing. :)

IMHO, 'kernel' and 'builtin' have a similar meaning here.
Is 'kernel.builtin' unnecessarily too long?


Perhaps, another idea is:

'builtin.alias' instead of 'modules.builtin.alias'
if we want a separate file in the same format.


In hindsight, 'modules.builtin' should have been
'builtin.order', I think.
