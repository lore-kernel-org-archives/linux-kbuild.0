Turning off all dependency-killing optimizations on all pointers is
likely a non-event.  Turning off all dependency-killing optimizations
on all integers is not the road to happiness.

So whatever "need" might be, it would need to be rather earthshaking.  ;-)
It is probably not -that- hard to convert to pointers, even if they
are indexing multiple arrays.

No argument here.

But it looks like we are going to have to tell the compiler.
