Let me clarify this.

I removed the version check in the following patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10225379/

So, you can enable CONFIG_GCC_PLAUGINS
as long as scripts/gcc-plugin.sh passes
(i.e. C++ can compile plugins).

Even if it is unlikely happen,
GCC 4.5 -> 4.8 is not a big jump.

People were recently talking about the minimum compiler version
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10207385/

The thread is super long, but my understanding was
4.5 or 4.6 would be reasonable.

So, we will be there sooner or later.
