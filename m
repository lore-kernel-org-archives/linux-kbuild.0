I agree, I've already made the change locally.

Well, it does seem to defeat a large part of the point of having generic
headers if they're not there by default - it means that if you add a
header you need to go round every single architecture adding the header
explicitly which is cumbersome and annoying, especially with the less
actively maintained architectures.  On the other hand if you do things
without adding a generic header then people whine about not using the
generic header mechanism...

I agree but I don't see this as something that should block having the
facility.  Or if it does I guess I'll need to try to either fix clkdev
to use the arch include optionally or go round all the architectures
either of which is going to be needlessly painful.

We could do that incrementally...

The reason I'm doing this is that the lack of a widely available clock
API is a considerable pain point for a lot of the stuff I work on and
this is the major blocker to just enabling the default implementation on
architectures that don't support it already which would be a big step
forwards.
