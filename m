Are you sure?

I'd recommend you to read the following:
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html


scripts/gcc-plugin.sh adds
  - ${srctree}"/../tools/gcc
  - ${gccplugins_dir}/include

to the header search path with "-I" option.


GCC looks for headers requested with #include <file>
in directories specified with "-I" as well as in the default ones.

So, how could this be the reason why we should avoid #include <file>?

Of course, you could use #include "..." as well to include kernel headers,
but you should not do that.

You should do so only when you need to include headers that are local
to your directory.
