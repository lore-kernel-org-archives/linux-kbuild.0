Let's fix it instead :)

Why not merge Arnd's 2 patches? I think he mostly addressed your concerns
of them. Or...

4dd1837d7589 diffstat is entirely in arch/arm. I think reverting that
would fix it (I haven't tested it myself so I would advise testing
before committing). So the ball is in your court.

As for process concerns, you have made valid points. Sometimes a mistake
is made or we make an incorrect assumption about how another person works
or what mailing lists they have read, or do not anticipate the fallout
from some change.

Everyone does it sometimes, so it's never a bad time to reflect on how
we work with others and try to do better.

Thanks,
Nick
