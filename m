I agree that the name kernel.builtin is unclear in what kind of
information it contains. Apologies for not having clarified this in
the previous review.

Since kbuild already produces "modules.order" and "modules.builtin"
files, why not just name it "modules.builtin.modinfo" to keep the
names consistent with what is already there? It clearly conveys that
this file contains modinfo for builtin modules.

I'll leave it up to Lucas to decide if the file format is OK for kmod.
With the modinfo dump, kmod could then decide what to do with the
information, append to modules.alias{,.bin}, etc.

Also, I think this file needs to be documented in Documentation/kbuild/kbuild.txt.

Thanks,

Jessica
