That's quite a old story with some history behind. Linus himself 
originally requested it, then much later asked the same question you did. 
See some background here:

	https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/20/227

The thing is, that things indeed have changed quite a bit since then. We 
are no longer in a situation that the generic driver would serve 99.99% of 
the world and the specific drivers would be just quirks.

Normally, yes. This was all introduced back when separating out all the 
messy quirks from generic hid driver into sub-drivers for maintaing 
sort-of backwards compatibility and avoid confusion.

Yes. Again, purely historical reasons.

As things have changed a lot since 2.6.28, we can try to put things more 
in line now for 3.11 or so.
