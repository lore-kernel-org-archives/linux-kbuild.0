Hi,

What are these missing headers? Because if they aren't necessary then they can
be removed from gcc-common.h. There were missing headers on arm/arm64 and these
archs are supported. I think this version check is unnecessary because
gcc-plugin.sh also checks the missing headers.

What is the problem on gcc-4.5/gcc-4.6?
