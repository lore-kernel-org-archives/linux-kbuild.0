Was there no compiler option to disable the optimization ?

Please do Cc me on your patches, either way we can coordinate changes depending
on which series gets merged. If your external_array() change lands upstream
first I'll see it on linux-next shortly can rebase and adjust code then as
that is what I base my patches on.

Do we know if there exceptions to the optimization issue for this and if so what
patterns follow ? We can test with simple userspace code if this will be an 
issue with gcc 7 by trying the demo in tools/linker-tables/ using this git tree
and branch 20160819-linker-table-v4 :
