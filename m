Okay, I was only testing thin archives. gc-sections I didn't look at.
With thin archives, one final arm allyesconfig link with this patch is
not showing a regression. gc-sections must be causing something else
ARM specific, because powerpc seems to link fast with gc-sections.

Can you send your latest ARM patch to enable this and I'll have a look
at it?

Yeah I was just trying to follow existing pattern and be conservative
with the workaround. From my brief look, it does seem like there is
room to optimize build options by having more fine grained selection
of target CPU/platform.

Thanks,
