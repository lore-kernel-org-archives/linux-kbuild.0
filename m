Hi Michal,

I'm wondering what your thoughts are with this series?

Sam had some other comment on patch 3, but I think it has come to a
matter of preference. I don't mind too much, so I can change it to
whatever people prefer (sh or makefile).

And did you want me to re-post the series, or are you happy to take
updated patches from replies?

The ARM slowness with allyesconfig builds with thin archives was a
linker workaround for a processor bug that they don't need to enable
for allyesconfig build anyway. I provided them a patch to avoid that.
For usual sized builds, it's not noticeable.

Thanks,
Nick
