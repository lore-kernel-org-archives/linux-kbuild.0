As you said in other email - "this has less to do with the attribute
being recognized, and simply just being because KASAN itself wants
gcc-4.9.2."

gcc < 4.9.2 simply doesn't have -fsanitize=kernel-address.
But no_sanitize attribute originally comes with user space ASAN (-fsanitize=address)
which exist in earlier GCCs like 4.8.
Checking against 4.8 gcc should be fine. If we compile the kernel with gcc 4.8
it will be compiled without instrumentation, so the attribute won't have any effect.

You're right, version checks shouldn't matter here. But __no_sanitize_address_or_inline
shouldn't have been added in the first place, because we already have almost the same __no_kasan_or_inline:

#ifdef CONFIG_KASAN
/*
 * We can't declare function 'inline' because __no_sanitize_address confilcts
 * with inlining. Attempt to inline it may cause a build failure.
 * 	https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67368
 * '__maybe_unused' allows us to avoid defined-but-not-used warnings.
 */
# define __no_kasan_or_inline __no_sanitize_address __maybe_unused
#else
# define __no_kasan_or_inline __always_inline
#endif

There are small differences like absence of notrace, but notrace could be added
to the function together with __no_kasan_or_inline.
And inline is *not* redefined to __always_inline  only on x86 when CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y

So there is absolutely no reason to have both __no_kasan_or_inline and __no_sanitize_address_or_inline.
