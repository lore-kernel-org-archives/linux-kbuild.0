For several reason I recommend CONFIG_EXPERT for all users, anyway.
But apart from that, what's wrong with "default y" and dropping any
CONFIG_EXPERT dependency? We can still keep the "tristate '..' if
EXPERT".

The CONFIG_EXPERT descriptions says "this option allows certain base
kernel options and settings to be disabled or tweaked". This really
doesn't say anything about "disable any non-standard options if this
is selected". So why do we default to "n" if CONFIG_EXPERT is
selected? This always bothered me because I don't expect the config to
change if I select it.

Cheers
David
