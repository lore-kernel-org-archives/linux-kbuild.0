Many thx.

I added this report to the list of regressions for Linux 4.9. I'll
watch this thread for further updates on this issue to document progress
in my weekly reports. Please let me know via regressions@leemhuis.info
in case the discussion moves to a different place (bugzilla or another
mail thread for example).

Current status (afaics): Fix available, waiting for Michal to get back
from vacation.

tia! Ciao, Thorsten
