I didn't follow the thread there, is it a regression caused by
thin archives, or just by removing the Kconfig symbol from each
file?

Not really sure. Possibly the way to do it would be to plumb
lib-y through drivers/ as well (like obj-y is) so they can be
linked on their own for the final vmlinux link.

But that may be quite a bit of churn, so it may be better to
hold such changes until we see how LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION
works out.
