Hmm, this won't make sense for ARM.  We have things like #warning and
deprecated functions in machine specific headers, and adding -Werror
to the whole of arch/arm/ will result in these causing builds to fail.

Adding it just for boot,common,kernel,lib,mm,nwfpe,oprofile,vfp (iow
everything except the mach-* and plat-* directories) would make sense
though.

I think that's the way we're going to _have_ to do it on ARM.
