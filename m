On ARM there are a few symbols that are part of the gcc support library 
such as division routines and so on.  Those are never called directly 
from C code. It is the compiler that implicitly creates references to 
them.  However, in order to be able to export those symbols, dummy C 
prototypes were used before it was possible to export symbols from asm 
code but those prototypes make no sense otherwise.  So the SYMBOL_CPROTO 
macro is there mainly to maintain backward compatibility with the 
traditional symbol version signature for those symbols.

The SYMBOL_CPROTO macro, being close to the actual code, could mark the 
intended definition for symbols in assembly code and allow for a tool to 
ensure there is no mismatch with the actual declaration located 
elsewhere. That could be useful for all global symbols, not just 
exported ones.  But that's not the primary reason why I created it.
