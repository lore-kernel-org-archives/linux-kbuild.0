Hi; yes indeed.

It looks like the linker decided to add .eh_frame sections even when all
the .o files lacked it. Adding this flag solved it (which I prefer over
adding it to DISCARD).

Since it was based on a -tip sub-branch I didn't push a
copy, but since you asked here it is:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kees/linux.git/log/?h=orphans/tip/x86/boot

And this email can serve as a "ping" to the arch maintainers too...
does this all look okay to you? I think it'd be a nice improvement. :)

Thanks!
