We *are* using Stephen's thin archives build infrastructure in the
kernel already. Only powerpc is using it so far: a5967db9af

The big one for powerpc build is that  the linker keeps relative
location of input sections the same, so as you link into larger
built-in.o files, there is less opportunity to place code optimally.
x86 may not care so much, but some other archs will.

The build output size improvement is nice for everyone though.

There is some explanation in sfr's patch. It's not thin archives
as such, but rather we have to link with --whole-archive, but it
was a very small impact.

IIRC today's final link is technically buggy without that option,
it's just that in practice the top-level built-in.o files pull in
so much that the linker will never discard one.

Thanks,
Nick
