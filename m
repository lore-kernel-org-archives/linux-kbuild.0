Turns out that I'd missed another oddity on some architectures.  ia64 and
parisc64 compile the kernel with pointers to functions actually pointing
to function descriptors and, unlike ppc64, need to have that spelled out
in asm literals (fptr@(foo) on ia64 and P%foo on parisc; foo itself would
refer to the function entry point, while on ppc64 foo would refer to descriptor
and .foo - to the entry point).

First of all, it means that exporting foo requires knowing whether it's
a function or not; C compiler has that information, but for assembler we
have to supply it manually.  Solution: EXPORT_DATA_SYMBOL{,_GPL} for exporting
non-functions (they are seriously outnumbered by function exports, so I kept
the EXPORT_SYMBOL{,_GPL} for those).  On normal architectures either can
be used, on ia64 and parisc we need to make sure to use the right one.

Another thing is that we need to know how to get from function name to the
descriptor for such architectures.  That's handled by defining KSYM_FUNC(name)
in asm/export.h.

Other changes since the previous posting:
	* unbreak linking of arch/ia64/hp/sim/boot/bootloader; it ended
up picking everything in arch/ia64/lib that contained some exports, and
some of those require stuff from the kernel proper.  Easy to fix, fortunately.
	* fix kbuild-related braino that ended up with the lib-ksyms.o
rebuilt for no reason.
	* fixes for assorted brainos picked by buildbot folded in.
	* ACKs applied (with the exception of the second patch in series -
asm-generic/export.h differences are considerable and I don't think that
ACK to the original variant automatically applies to the new one).

If everyone (including kbuild folks) is OK with the arch-independent parts of
this series, I'd like to put the first two commits into never-rebased branch
so that individual architecture trees could pull that and apply the
corresponding arch-dependent stuff on top of that; going that way would
minimize the amount of conflicts that would need to be dealt with during
this cycle, but it obviously depends on those first two commits being
acceptable to everyone.  Please, review and comment.
