unfortunately, i don't know of a way to quantify this kind of PRNG as the effective
algorithm is not something simple and well-structured for which we have theories and
tools to analyze already. of course this cuts both ways, an attacker faces the same
barrier of non-analyzability.

what can at most be observed is the state of the latent_entropy global variable after
init across many boots but that'd provide a rather low and useless lower estimate only
(e.g., up to 20 bits for a million reboots, or 30 bits for a billion reboots, etc).

to answer your question, i'd like to believe that there's enough latent entropy in
program state that can be harnessed to (re)seed the entropy pool but we'll probably
never know just how well we are doing it so accounting for it and claiming 'fixed'
will stay in the realm of wishful thinking i'm afraid.
