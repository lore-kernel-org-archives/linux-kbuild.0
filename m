In the above you nicely describes what is done.
But there is nothing about the target group for this feature.
Who will benefit from this?

With respect to the actual implmentation we now
have two ways to handle config fragments.
Current solution is to save the config fragments in kernel/configs.
And the new solution is to parse the config fragments from an rst file.
The changelog fails to mentions why we need a new way to handle
the config fragments.

If we want to go the "parse from rst file" way - can it then
be abstracted in a way so this is the only way to handle
these in-kernel config fragments?
And then move the current config fragment to the new way.

It most be possible with a little careful design to make this
a general solution and not a hardening thing only.
