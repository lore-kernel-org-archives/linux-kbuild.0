I'm not sure I like this at all.

The goal for moving EXPORT_SYMBOL() to assembly code where symbols were 
defined is to make things close together and avoid those centralized 
list of symbols that you can easily miss when modifying the actual code.

This series is therefore bringing back a centralized list of symbols in 
a slightly different form, nullifying the advantages from having moved 
EXPORT_SYMBOL() to asm code.  To me this looks like a big step backward.

Why not simply extending the original idea of keeping exports close to 
the actual code by _also_ having a macro that provides the function 
prototype alongside the EXPORT_SYMBOL() instance?  That could even be 
expressed with some EXPORT_SYMBOL_PROTO(ret, sym, arg...) macro that 
does it all.
