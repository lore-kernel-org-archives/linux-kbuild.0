(Thanks Masahiro for the CC!)

Yeah, you'll only find builtin modules under /sys/module/ if it has any module
parameters, otherwise you won't find it there. As Masahiro already mentioned,
if a builtin module has any parameters, they would be accessible under /sys/module/.

Hm, I do see one possible additional use-case for preserving module alias
information for built-in modules - modprobe will currently error (I think,
correct me if I'm wrong) if we try invoking modprobe with an alias of a
built-in module, simply because this information is not in modules.builtin or
modules.alias.

Since kbuild already outputs modules.builtin, I would suggest outputting
something like a modules.builtin.alias file (and I guess maybe a modules.builtin.param
file too if that's deemed useful), in a format that is consumable by kmod/modprobe,
so that modprobing an alias of a built-in module doesn't produce an error. I
think this should be easy to do if we keep and parse the resulting .modinfo for
builtin modules. This is just an idea, opinions welcome. I've added Lucas to CC
in case he has any thoughts.


Thanks,

Jessica
