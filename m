My patch 2/2 needs the following incremental patch applied. It is
to preprocess the .S file properly as asm the same way the kernel
build does, and then building the dummy C from there.

Without this, we don't necessarily get proper symbol expansion or
get conditional compilation, etc. With it, genksyms should see what
the assembler sees.
