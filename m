sure about which part? ;) the use of <...> vs "..." is a matter of convention (to
differentiate between 'system' headers from the program's own) and for gcc the plugin
headers don't count as 'system' headers, gcc uses "..." throughout its codebase itself
(so does clang/llvm). it'd look weird and inconsistent if compiler plugins used <...>.

at the end of the day this comes down to whether gcc plugins are considered kernel
code and thus the kernel style applies to them (the kernel itself uses <...> because
it's a freestanding program so its 'system' headers are mostly what it provides
itself, not those of the compiler let alone userland libs) or gcc extensions and thus
the gcc include style applies to them. as you can guess, i'm arguing for the latter,
because gcc plugins are meant for the compiler, not the kernel per se, and in fact
we have several plugins already that can be used in userland as well (e.g., Emese's
size overflow plugin).

the one thing for plugins that i borrowed from the kernel instead of gcc is the code
formatting style as the GNU one is as bad as Linus argued decades ago ;).

because <...> is meant for headers that are on the compiler's default search path
and even if gcc plugin headers were there (they aren't) they'd be the wrong ones
to use, you'd have to specifically override the include path with that of the target
compiler which is a sign that you're no longer including 'system' headers (again,
this convention holds for hosted programs, freestanding ones don't have anything
but 'system' headers usually).

sorry, i take that back, the kernel uses <...> but for a reason that in my opinion
doesn't apply to compiler plugins (see above).

sure, a header in the same directory is a sign that it's not a 'system' header but
i'm also saying that there can be other non-system headers in a program in other
directories as well. FWIW, the kernel itself has several "..." directives that
reference headers outside of the same directory, e.g., try this in a kernel tree:

  grep "#include.*\"\." -rn
