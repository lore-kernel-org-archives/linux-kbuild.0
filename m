Alan Modra recommended this approach several years ago, and I think
Stephen was the first to implement this for the kernel.
It would be good to have the rational whay ar is better than ld -r
included in the commit message for later reference.

I also recall that using ar gave some small kernel size reductions
from last time we played with this.
This info could also be nice to give a rough idea of the impact.

Added Alan to list of receivers.
