A previous patch added the --no-wchar-size-warning to the Makefile to
avoid this harmless warning:

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: warning: drivers/xen/efi.o uses 2-byte wchar_t yet the output is to use 4-byte wchar_t; use of wchar_t values across objects may fail

Changing kbuild to use thin archives instead of recursive linking
unfortunately brings the same warning back during the final link.

This time, we remove the -fshort-wchar flag that originally caused
the warning, hopefully fixing the problem for good. I don't see
any reason for having the flag in the first place, as the Xen code
does not use wchar_t at all.

It would be nice to get this patch merged along with the thin
archive conversion, either by merging it through the xen
Tree, or by making it part of Nick's series with an Ack
from the xen maintainers.
