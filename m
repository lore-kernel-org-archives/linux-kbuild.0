This scripts has been 5-year broken,
and I did not see any complaint except from you.
So, I wonder how many people are using this.

Nor, do I understand how to use it.

Could you teach me a bit more about this script?



Something might be missing in my mind, but
I do not know how to use this script in a useful way.



It provides three checks.

[1] list_multiply_defined()

This warns multiple definition of functions.

The compiler would fail if it saw any multiple definition,
so the reports from this check are all false-positive.


[2] resolve_external_references()

This warns unresolved symbols.

The compiler would fail if it saw any unresolved symbol,
so the reports from this check are all false-positive, too.




[3] list_extra_externals

This warns symbols with no reference.

This potentially contains lots of false-positives.
For example, the core framework provides APIs, but if all drivers
are disabled, there is no user of those APIs.




I built the kernel with x86_64_defconfig,
and namespacecheck provides

1400 line reports for [1].
200 line reports for [2].
6800 line reports for [3].

Most of these seem false-positives.



How can I use it for the code improvement?

[3] might be still useful to find 'static' candidates,
but it would be difficult given the amount of the report.
