Based on feedback from Stephen, Guang and Arnd here
is a new patchset supporting generic headers.

Changes since v2:
- Fix spelling miss in LINUXINCLUDE (Stephen)
- Properly delete file with mrproper (Guang)
- Fixed support for headers that are not exported (Guang)
- New way to list files used from the generic set (Arnd)

We now list which files are sued from the generic set in:
arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm/Kbuild like this:

    generic-y += termios.h
