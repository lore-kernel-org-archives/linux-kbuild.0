The patch

   regulator: add dummy function of_find_regulator_by_node

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: add dummy function of_find_regulator_by_node

If device tree is not enabled, of_find_regulator_by_node() should have
a dummy function since the function call is still there.

This is to fix build error after CONFIG_NO_AUTO_INLINE is introduced.
If this option is enabled, GCC will not auto-inline functions that are
not explicitly marked as inline.

In this case (no CONFIG_OF), the copmiler will report error in function
regulator_dev_lookup().

W/O NO_AUTO_INLINE, function of_get_regulator() is auto-inlined and then
the call to of_find_regulator_by_node() is optimized out since
of_get_regulator() always return NULL.

W/ NO_AUTO_INLINE, the return value of of_get_regulator() is a variable
so the call to of_find_regulator_by_node() cannot be optimized out. So
we need a stub of_find_regulator_by_node().

static struct regulator_dev *regulator_dev_lookup(struct device *dev,
						  const char *supply)
{
	struct regulator_dev *r = NULL;
	struct device_node *node;
	struct regulator_map *map;
	const char *devname = NULL;

	regulator_supply_alias(&dev, &supply);

	/* first do a dt based lookup */
	if (dev && dev->of_node) {
		node = of_get_regulator(dev, supply);
		if (node) {
			r = of_find_regulator_by_node(node);
			if (r)
				return r;
	...
