I guess it really depends on how exactly you want to use it. For distros
that do stable ABI but rarely may have to break something for security
reasons, it should work and give exact control.

What else do people *actually* use it for? Preventing mismatched modules
when .git version is not attached and release version of the kernel has
not been bumped. Is that it?

Yeah... turns out modversions is in the "kind of useless" camp.

The crc is based on the name of the type and that's it (that's what I
thought, I just now verify it).

So we have:

1. The distro users. They don't break ABI, they really just want a way to
   avoid the kernel version check.

2. Linus or other kernel developer who wants to prevent a kernel
   accidentally loading out of date modules when they test some changes
   that don't bump kernel version.

3. Advanced end user who does not want to have to recompile their nvidia
   blob.

Anything else? So, how to handle them?

1. Distros may just want a way to avoid checking some minor part of the
   version string. In rare cases where they do break ABI, they can just
   rename the symbol: external modules have a distro/version compat layer
   anyway.

2. I wonder if this is still important 8 years later now that everyone
   uses git everywhere? :) I also don't think modversions helps this case
   reliably because we don't change export types all that often. Can we
   ship a git version in the source tree somehow that git can handle
   specially?

3. These people today are not well supported with modversions because it
   does not tell them about incompatibility of ABI. Semantics could change.
   Structure args could change. Objects derived through various pointers
   could change. We should not even bother trying IMO. Just let them do
   forced loading at their own risk. We shouldn't offer a false sense of
   security.

Thanks,
Nick
