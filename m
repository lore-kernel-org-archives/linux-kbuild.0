I understand and won't disagree with you. :-)

Unfortunately, there are various drivers that will never go upstream

- paid storage drivers that provide bells and whistles on top of inbox
  driver
- old drivers/fs that application has been relying on for a long time but
  company doesn't have resources to migrate to current technology.

We have been trying over the years to do what we can to move customers in
the right direction.  It is just a slow process, sadly.

Cheers,
