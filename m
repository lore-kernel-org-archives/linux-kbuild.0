Yeah, I had the same idea as you and Michal too. It's conceptually nicer,
but in practice it turned into a mess. If some architectures wanted to start
protecting their .h files and including them into .S for the prototypes, we
could start parsing those too. Should we do the quick and dirty way for 4.9?
