I'm not in favour of this.

   +extern void mmioset(void *, unsigned int, size_t);
   +extern void mmiocpy(void *, const void *, size_t);
   +
    #ifndef __ARMBE__
    static inline void memset_io(volatile void __iomem *dst, unsigned c,
           size_t count)
    {
   -       extern void mmioset(void *, unsigned int, size_t);
           mmioset((void __force *)dst, c, count);
    }

The reason they're declared _within_ memset_io() is to prevent people
from using them by hiding their declaration.  Moving them outside is
an open invitation to stupid people starting to use them as an "oh it
must be an official API".

We know this happens, there's been a long history of this kind of stupid
in the ARM community, not only with cache flushing APIs, but also the
DMA APIs.

The way the existing code is written is a completely valid way to hide
declarations from outside the intended caller's scope.

We've been here many times, we've had many people doing this crap, so
I'm now at the point of NAKing changes which result in an increased
visibility to the rest of the kernel of symbols that should not be
used by stupid driver authors.

Now, why do we have these extra functions when they're just aliased to
memset()/memcpy() - to avoid GCC optimising them because it thinks that
they're standard memset()/memcpy().

So overall this gets a NAK from me.

Now, it would have _ALSO_ been nice to have been at least COPIED on the
original set of changes that caused the need for this change.  I wasn't.
So I want to see the original set of changes reverted, because they're
clearly causing breakage.  Let's revert them and then go through the
proper process of maintainer review, rather than bypassing maintainers
and screwing up architectures in the process.  There really is no
excuse for this crap.
