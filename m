Sorry, I haven't time to look - it needs me to use firefox on a
different machine.  Maybe you could help by providing some details
by email, otherwise I've got extra work to do at some point in the
future (probably days away) if I remember (your mail will get buried).
Much of my time is in front of a _textual_ _only_ interface, and elinks
does not work with several modern SSL-only sites.

Yea, all SSL sites, I'm not going to try elinks with them, I don't
have the time to mess around.
