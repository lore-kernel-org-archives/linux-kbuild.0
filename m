I don't think this makes sense.  This script claims to extract a "vmlinux"
from a compressed kernel image.  "vmlinux" is normally the term of the
ELF object, and indeed as the script currently stands, it always guarantees
to output an ELF file.

However, ARM zImage does not store a compressed ELF object, it stores a
compressed binary image of the executable in memory, so what you get out
of this script is not an ELF file, but the binary image (iow, what
arch/arm/boot/Image is.)

What's the use case - what are you using the output of this script with?

Right, so passing the second argument as 1 bypasses the "is it ELF" check.

and here you always pass '1', thereby bypassing the ELF check for every
architecture.  What if some architecture stores another compressed
object in the same compressed image?  I suspect the check is there to
ensure that it works on architectures where the compressed kernel image
contains other compressed objects.
