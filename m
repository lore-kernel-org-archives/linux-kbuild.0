Sure. That is what I do for mainline PRs to Linus. As you say, it
works fine for mostly independent trees. But it doesn't (that well)
for out-of-tree stuff or for stuff spanning several trees.

Exactly. And for this case, I simply assumed Stephen wanted a clean
series to apply on top of the latest next-* tag (same way we base
stuff on top of -rc*s). Note that this is *not* really a "tree"
collecting changes/development, it is a patch series, i.e. what is
important is only the range-diff.

What has surprised me is that -next does not allow for range-diffs
(patches/commits/...) to be inside -next, maybe applied after all the
normal merges of trees. I simply assumed it did, given what I could
find about -next (which does not seem to be documented properly, by
the way).

While this is a simple conflict, I don't really agree with release
maintainers having to fix conflicts on the fly (even if it is a single
trivial line), but that is an orthogonal discussion...

Alright, I am not sure how to answer this without sounding
"aggressive" and maybe I misunderstood something you tried to point
out, so I apologize in advance. There are several points here:

  * The merge conflict isn't related to this (but let's assume it was,
since you pointed this out as an example -- I guess; although I am not
sure why).

  * Thanks for explaining, but I think most people here understand how
#ifndef works :-) Also note that we already had guards for some
attributes that needed per-compiler implementations.

  * The patch is actually necessary:

    - Several people argued that examples should be present when I
introduced __nonstring earlier in the series. While I don't think they
are mandatory for this case, they are good to have, and since they
were anyway requested, I happily added them.

    - Changes should include everything related to them (as far as
possible, i.e. extreme examples aside). Adding __nonstring and not
removing the ext4 part would simply be leaving undone work (which has
to be done sooner or later). To be honest, it could have even been
done in the same commit and I would say it is logically OK (even if
not great).

    - Related to that: I think the outer #ifndef shouldn't have been
included to begin with, because it is either wrong or dead code: if we
end up having a __nonstring, it should be removed at the same time
(like this series does); and if __nonstring isn't there (like now), it
isn't guarding against anything. At worst, it could hide a mismatch in
the definitions.

    - I promised to you I would clean it up :-)

You seem to argue that it is better to avoid merge conflicts rather
than doing a proper series. Well, I think we should really try to
avoid conflicts pushing down the """quality""" of
patches/commits/series.

Cheers,
Miguel
