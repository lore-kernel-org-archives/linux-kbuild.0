My understanding is that it's not cryptographically secure, but it
provides a way for different machines and different boots to end up
with different seeds here, which is a big improvement over some of the
embedded devices that all boot with the same entropy every time.

I would, however, like to see the documentation improved to describe
the "How" and "Why". The "What" is pretty well covered. Adding
comments to the plugin for kernel developers (not compiler developers)
would help a lot: assume the reader knows nothing about gcc plugins.
