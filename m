Thank you Robin. The "S<op0>_<op1>_<Cn>_<Cm>_<op2>" is the feature I
was looking for. I'm not going to remove old toolchain from every user
machine - I believe if I do, I'll be put into jail finally. :)

But I think we should use this syntax for {read,write}_sysreg_s
and other functions if assembler supports it. The existing mrs_s/msr_s
machinery will be deprecated then, and it will be generally good.

Sami told that LTO doesn't work with old toolchains, so I think that
it would be OK to disable LTO for old assemblers that doesn't support
all necessary features. Anyway, this is not blocking issue because we
have patch that workarounds it (again).
