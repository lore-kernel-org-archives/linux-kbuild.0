Hi David,

Sorry for the late reply.

There is a contradiction in your proposal. The tristate "..." if EXPERT
_is_ a CONFIG_EXPERT dependency, and that's exactly what I would like to
see go away. "default y" would be fine with me.

I agree that this kind of option-dependent default value can easily be
confusing. I suppose it was done that way for historical reasons, to
minimize the effect of changes while the HID subsystem was being
reworked. But I would like to see it go away now.
