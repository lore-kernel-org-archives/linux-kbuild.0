With these two patches together, does it work for you?

http://marc.info/?l=linux-arch&m=147653546809512&w=2
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=147669851906489&w=2

It would be helpful if you could test and let us know, because there seems
to be a very tiny number of configs and toolchains that causes problems.
