Well I simply tested the outcome. If you have:

struct blah {
  int x;
};
int foo(struct blah *blah)
{
  return blah->x;
}
EXPORT(foo);

$ nm vmlinux | grep __crc_foo
00000000a0cf13a0 A __crc_foo

Now change to

struct blah {
  int y;
  int x;
};

$ nm vmlinux | grep __crc_foo
00000000a0cf13a0 A __crc_foo

It just doesn't catch these things. Honestly, stable ABI distros *have*
to review all patches to ensure the ABI is unchanged. Some tools could
help significantly, but for that, the debug info ABI checking tools that
have been mentioned in this thread are far better tool for this job than
modversions.

Thanks,
Nick
