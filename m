Heh, so earlier we decided against compiler flags (-std=gnu89 or
-fgnu89-inline) in preference to function attributes.  The function
attribute is preferable as some of the Makefiles [accidentally?]
overwrite KBUILD_CFLAGS, which is problematic for gcc 5.1 users as the
implicit c standard used was changed to gnu11 from gnu89.  What's nice
is that to support gcc 4.1 users, we simply don't need to add any
attribute, as their implicit c standard is gnu89 which has the
semantics for extern inline that we want.  I have a simple change to
this patch that can support users of various gcc versions, see below:

Yes, but that's only for x86, IIUC.  It seems the kernel may have
different minimum required versions of GCC based on arch then?  That
may be ok, but I'm not sure that's easy to keep track of without
having it explicitly stated somewhere like the docs perhaps?

Those will be helpful.  If we want to pursue compiler flags, which get
set some Makefiles, then yes.  But I think a simpler change to my
patch would be as below.

It seems gcc did not get __has_attribute [0] until 5.1, but will
define __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ if supported. [1]  Unfortunately, Clang
does not define __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ [2].  So a proper feature test
might look like:

```
#ifndef __has_attribute
#define __has_attribute(x) 0
#endif

#if defined(__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__) || __has_attribute(gnu_inline)
#define __gnu_inline __attribute__(gnu_inline)
#endif

#define inline inline __attribute__((always_inline, unused)) notrace
__gnu_inline
```

Thoughts on this approach? I can send a v5 tomorrow if there's no
major issues.  Feedback appreciated, as always.
