I'm inclined to leave it, "visible to C sources" doesn't seem like that
much of an issue and IMHO the cure (kernel/dts/...) is worse than the
disease.

If it did, yes. I don't think vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi does, since it is using
/include/ today. I'm inclined to switch back to /include/ unless someone
objects.

Indeed, I've done that locally already.
