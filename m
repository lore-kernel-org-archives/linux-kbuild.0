Hmm, those seem to have gone in during the last week, so I haven't
tested it yet (build running, but it'll take a while).  However, I
don't think they'll solve _this_ problem.

Some of the issue here is that we use a mixture of assembly macros
and preprocessor for the ARM bitops - the ARM bitops are created
with an assembly macro which contains some pre-processor expanded
macros (eg, EXPORT_SYMBOL()).

This means that the actual symbol being exported is not known to
the preprocessor, so doing the "__is_defined(__KSYM_##sym)" inside
"EXPORT_SYMBOL(\name)" becomes "__is_defined(__KSYM_\name)" to the
preprocessor.  As "__KSYM_\name" is never defined, it always comes
out as zero, hence we always use __cond_export_sym_0, which omits
the symbol export from the assembly macro definition:

 .macro bitop, name, instr
.globl \name ; .align 0 ; \name:

...

.type \name, %function; .size \name, .-\name

 .endm

In other words, using preprocessor macros inside an assembly macro
may not work as expected, and now leads to config-specific failures.
