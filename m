Looks almost perfect to me now.

I was about to reply with Reviewed-by, but then it occurred to me
that scripts/asm-generic.sh is really much more complicated
than doing the same in Makefile syntax.

You already create the wrapper files during headers-install, so why
not also create them from make, where we already have access to the
file lists in a convenient format.

Or is there a problem getting at stuff defined in the Kbuild files
from the prepare stage?
