Perhaps the example plugin is unnecessary. I should use the cyclomatic complexity plugin
because I already wrote about it in the sections "Usage" and "How to add a new GCC plugin"
and they differ by only two lines.

I think gcc has very good documentation about plugins, I reference them from gcc-plugins.txt,
you can see it below. If you think it isn't enough tell me please what you would like to
see as additional documentation.
