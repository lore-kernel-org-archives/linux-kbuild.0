asm-prototypes.h in his patch includes asm/ftrace.h, where the function
is declared. That should be enough IIUC scripts/Makefile.build.

I suppose people don't run i386 kernels or have different config.

Not at all. This was plain 4.9 packaged by suse -- only rpm-related
fixes. I tried plain 4.9 without rpm right now with the same output:
# insmod soundcore.ko
[   31.582326] soundcore: disagrees about version of symbol mcount
[   31.586183] soundcore: Unknown symbol mcount (err -22)
insmod: ERROR: could not insert module soundcore.ko: Invalid parameters
