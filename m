The x86_64 is still a WIP, but hopefully we'll succeed.

Terrific. I'll move ahead in that direction then. It makes things _so_
much cleaner, and doesn't introduce new build modes ("should the
generated _ship go into the build directory or the source directory?
what kind of artifact is it? how to address $(srcdir) vs $(src) in
that context? bla bla") that really over complicate things.
