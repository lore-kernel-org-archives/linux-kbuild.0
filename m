It is only the type name.

Not only that but even if you did extend it further to structure type
arrangement then you still have to deal with other structures followed
via pointers. Or (rarer but not unheard of):

- changes to structures without changes of the types of their members
- changes to arguments without changes of their type
- changes to semantics of functions
- data structures derived in ways other than exported symbols, e.g.,
  fixed register for `current` on some archs

This is actually a big problem with it, that it provides a false sense
of security. It simply can't be used to verify your ABI stability.

 [Aside: something like the tool Greg linked earlier,

 https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/talks/would-an-abi-changes-visualization-tool-be-useful-to-linux-kernel-maintenance/

 Would be great if that worked with the kernel. Not necessarily as part
 of the build system, but at least a tool that distros could use to
 analyze ABI changes. It wouldn't catch everything, but it would be far
 better than modversions.]

I still don't think modversions helps there. And how much burden is it
to change the export function names occasionally? I thought it was *very*
rare that an ABI change was required in distros.

I just didn't realize what you wanted the blacklist for. It sounded like
you wanted to be able to just wholesale prevent a module's symbols from
being exported.
