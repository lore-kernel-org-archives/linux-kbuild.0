To help isolate changes.

If you constantly upgrade everything, how do you bug hunt for a breakage?
How do you know whether it's created by the kernel, or by (eg) a later
version of gcc miscompiling the kernel.  You have a large amount of code
to start bug hunting through.

Sticking with particular tool versions long-term means that you build up
confidence in it - yes, sure, latent bugs exist, but it's easier to
bug hunt if you aren't constantly suspecting that your tools might be
broken.

For example, I build kernels with:

		gcc		binutils		built on
32-bit ARM	4.7.4		2.25			April/May 2015
64-bit ARM	4.9.2		2.25.51.20150219	Feb/April 2015

I'm not anticipating upgrading them for some time yet - the only one
which may get upgraded is the 64-bit binutils since later kernels now
complain about a missing errata workaround in that toolchain version.

I do still have some older toolchains around on some of my ARM boxes
though, even a GCC 3 version with ARM TLS support for faster builds!
