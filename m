This indeed looks dodgy. I'm not sure about the makefile rules but would
the above override the "prepare" target in the top Makefile?

I think a dependency problem we have is that arch/arm64/kernel/signal.o
depends on include/generated/vdso-offsets.h. However, we don't have any
target for the latter, only for
$(objtree)arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso-offsets.h which no-one is
including. Because of this, we have a fake dependency in
arch/arm64/kernel/Makefile.

It's been a long time since I wrote makefiles but I think a simpler
approach may be to just get the include/generated/vdso-offsets.h target
and remove the arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso-offsets.h one entirely like
below. Otherwise, we give up on storing the generated file in
include/generated/ and move arch/arm64/include/asm/vdso.h to
arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/.
