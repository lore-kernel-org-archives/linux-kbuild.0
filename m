This warning is enabled at "make W=1" level, and found a bunch of
actual problems in code that adds -I flags to nonexisting directories.
All of these are harmless, but clearly wrong.

Kbuild itself also adds a bunch of extra directories, including in
some cases those outside of the kernel tree (e.g. ../../include),
which can have surprising consequences.

This series fixes all the warnings I found with -Wmissing-include-dirs
enabled on ARM randconfigs and x86 allmodconfig. The non-Kbuild
patches can all be applied independently, while we probably want
the Kbuild stuff to be kept as a series, if we decide to merge them.

I have added my test patch at the end, mainly to see if the Kbuild
bot finds any other warnings on additional architectures.

Arnd Bergmann (11):
  Kbuild: don't add ../../ to include path
  Kbuild: avoid duplicate include path
  Kbuild: always prefix objtree in LINUXINCLUDE
  Kbuild: arch: look for generated headers in obtree
  Kbuild: don't add obj tree in additional includes
  ARM: don't include removed directories
  ARM: hide mach-*/ include for ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M
  drm: amd: remove broken include path
  net: skfb: remove obsolete -I cflag
  rtlwifi: don't add include path for rtl8188ee
  [EXPERIMENTAL] Kbuild: enable -Wmissing-include-dirs by default
