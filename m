Is there a reason to prefer using linker scripts rather than thin
archives? I thought the former was possibly a bit less robust, and
the latter a smaller change for scripts and toolchain in terms
of "almost behaving like an object file".

I don't have a strong preference although do have a couple of
(out of tree) scripts that expect objdump to work on built-in.o

Thanks,
