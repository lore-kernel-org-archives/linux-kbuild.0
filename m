I tried just changing the THIN_ARCHIVES "bool" into "def_bool y" to
test it on my laptop, and certainly saw neither build problems nor
problems with the resulting kernel image.

So honestly, I'd really rather just see the change happen
unconditionally, and finding problems much quicker and easier that way
(in addition to making the conversion much simpler and not asking
people odd questions).
