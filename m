A normal user can install tests at any location they choose by
overriding the default path. For example:

INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/tmp make kselftest_install

will install under tmp.

The approach I used also ties test installs to kernel release.
This addresses an important use-case for kernel developers
that want to compare results from release to release.

The use-case for any user to be able to install tests at
any location is addressed by the above example.

I would like these two above use-cases continued to be supported,
especially the one that tries the test installs to kernel release.
Another goal is to keep changes to the main Makefile minimal and
the rest of the install support belongs under selftests/Makefile
and any other include file (like the one you proposed).

The patch I have in patch v4 addresses the use-cases mentioned above.
I do like the lib.mk approach in general and I am going to review that
patch and give you feedback.

thanks,
