This appears to be the only thing to fix, right?

I believe inclusion of <linux/bitops.h> is the right thing to do, but if
not, the patch would also need:

extern unsigned int __sw_hweight8(unsigned int w);
extern unsigned int __sw_hweight16(unsigned int w);
extern unsigned int __sw_hweight32(unsigned int w);
extern unsigned long __sw_hweight64(__u64 w);


There's also the issue of mcount/__fentry__, but that's apparently already
dealt with in 5de0a8c, already in mainline.

The update is trivial, but yeah, I can resubmit.  If I'm wrong about where
__sw_hweight{8,16,32,64} should come from, please say so.
