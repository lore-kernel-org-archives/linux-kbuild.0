To be honest, I would also prefer an interface that uses C strings or
literals for the new EXPORT_SYMBOLS* macros:

  EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(mysym, "USB_STORAGE");

  or

  const char USB_STORAGE_NS[] = "USB_STORAGE";
  EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(mysym, USB_STORAGE_NS);

The DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE define within Makefiles would get a bit
more verbose in that case to express the literal:
  ccflags-y += -DDEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE="\"USB_STORAGE\""


The main reason against that, is, that in the expansion of
EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS, we define the ksymtab entry, which name is
constructed partly by the name of the namespace:

   static const struct kernel_symbol __ksymtab_##sym##__##ns  ...
                                                        ^^^^

For that we depend on a cpp symbol to construct the name. I am not sure
there is a reasonable way of getting rid of that without ending up
constructing the ksymtab entries completely in asm as it is already done
in case of PREL32_RELOCATIONS. But I am happy to be corrected.

For reference that is done in patch 03/11 of this series:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190821114955.12788-4-maennich@google.com/

Cheers,
Matthias
