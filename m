Perhaps - but since sorting is a requirement, people building such
systems must have found a way... Anyway, I don't see where both
your and Heiko's comment are heading, since the situation is even
worse without the patch afaics (since .text gets marked read-only
as much as .rodata does, and could equally be placed in ROM).
