Sorry for the late reply, I was moving house and got side tracked.

It's heavy handed in that it is quite complex in the kernel build system,
but it is also light handed in that it does not do a very good job.

I would say the degree of confidence is not very high. People have told
me modversions follows pointers to objects in its calculation, but I have
not seen that to be the case. Even if you did have that, it can not replace
a code review for semantics of data and code.

As a tool to aid distro reviewers, modversions has some value, but the
debug info parsing tools that have been mentioned in this thread seem
superior (not that I've tested them).

Oh yeah my aim here is not to make distro or out of tree module vendors
life harder, actually the opposite. If it turns out modversions really is
the best approach, I'm not in a position to complain about its complexity
because we have Suse and Redhat people maintaining the build and module
systems :) I just want to see if we can do things better.

Thanks,
Nick
