Just for the record, there are 2 reasons actually I decided to do this:

1. the address slot is already occupied, check if any adjacent slots are
   free;
2. accesses that straddle a slot boundary due to size that exceeds a
   slot's range may check adjacent slots if any watchpoint matches.

In /sys/kernel/debug/kcsan I can see no_capacity with the current version stays
below 10 for kernel boot. When I just use 1 slot, no_capacity events exceed
90000, because point (1) is no longer addressed. This is a problem that would
impair our ability to detect races.  One reason this happens is due to
locality: it is just much more likely that we have multiple accesses to the
same pages during some phase of execution from multiple threads.

To avoid blowing up no_capacity events, insert_watchpoint should not change. I
will change the iteration order in the fast-path (avoiding the complicated
logic), and add additional overflow entries to the watchpoint array.

AFAIK this generates better code, while still addressing points (1) and
(2) above. This should be the best trade-off between absolute
performance and our ability to detect data races.
