Would that actually help, or would it only give you a false feeling of safety?
Most "multiplatform" sub-architectures (like iMX or "shmobile") still have
multiple families and SoCs, so you have to repeat the exercise at that level.

Still, even when configuring a kernel for a single SoC, the final board
selection is at the DTS level.

Conclusion: If you want NOMMU and/or XIP, you have to know what you're doing,
and hand-holding at whatever level may not save you from making mistakes.

That's actually an interesting one: no manual configuration (iff parameters
would be extracted from the DTB), so nothing can go wrong ;-)
I guess it applies to NOMMU, too.
