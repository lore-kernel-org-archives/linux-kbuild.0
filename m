You definitely don't have to try to convince me. We've had many issues
with modversions over the years. This was just the "last drop" as far
as I'm concerned, we've had random odd crc generation failures due to
some build races too.

So at least Fedora doesn't even enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS as-is. I'm
_hoping_ it's just Debian that wants this, and we'd need to get some
input from the Debian people whether that "control vermagic" is
sufficient? I suspect it isn't, but I can't come up with any simple
alternate model either..

I'm also somewhat surprised that it's Debian that has this problem,
considering how Debian is usually the distro that is _least_ receptive
to various non-free binaries.
