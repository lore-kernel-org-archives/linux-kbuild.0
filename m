I've tested the v6 patches on arm, and partially on arm64.  The arm64
gcc has a bug in make install that doesn't install all necessary
headers to build plugins.  I believe the patch will work once that
version gets out.  It does, however, print a helpful message now
explaining the likely cause of the failure.
