Nope, userspace just tries to open /dev/cfs0, or a manually configured
alternative. We have only used linux/coda.h, and actually carry our own
copy of that file which is kept in sync manually, which is why there are
all those ifdefs for different systems in there. This all originates
from the time of the 2.1.x kernels when Coda was built externally.

Agreed.
