Quick overview:

- asm exports changes allow EXPORT_SYMBOL to be moved into .S files,
  but they would not get modversion CRCs generated.

- The core kbuild patches to add modversions support for asm exports
  is now merged in Linus's tree from the recent kbuild tree pull.
  asm/asm-prototypes.h must contain C style declarations of the symbol
  for this to work.

- Architectures can now add their asm/asm-prototypes.h and things
  *should* start working.

- Dependency is not a hard one. If you add asm-prototypes.h before
  merging the core patches then it should not introduce any problems.

I don't think you have missed much since last it came up, it's just
taken a bit of time to get the details right and get it merged.

Not sure what your tree looks like, but if you merge this patch 1/2
plus 2a/2 or 2b/2 into upstream, then ARM should be working.

Thanks,
