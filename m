Hi,

KTSAN checks acquire/release pairs, and that's very useful. But as far
as I understand this thread is about more subtle things and areas of
kernel/compiler tension. I afraid this in this context KTSAN is in the
same boat as compiler. Because, well, we need to write code that
implements precise algorithms. And if control-dependencies are defined
as "extreme care is required to avoid control-dependency-destroying
compiler optimizations" (that is, code is correct if it does not break
against the current set of enabled optimizations in the current
compiler, what?) and data-dependencies are defined akin to C11
definition (read -- non-implementable, unicorns); then KTSAN can't
help.

When/if C provides implementable rules for data-dependencies
(_Dependency) and that's implemented in compilers and kernel sticks to
this model, then I guess it should be possible to extract that info
from compiler and check against it in KTSAN (e.g. 2 synchronization
domains, one for dependent accesses and one for everything else).
Kernel could as well define own model, and KTSAN could check against
it. But that model must be implemented in compilers first anyway.
Because (1) doing it just for KTSAN does not look reasonable, (2)
until compiler supports that model there is little point in checking
(the fact that compiler uses a different model is the major gaping
hole and we are aware of it without tooling help).

And, yes, I agree that we should not block this LTO patch. All
problems are already there and are orthogonal to LTO. Compiler sees
enough code already (large TUs, lots of code in headers) and we move
code. I also have not seen any special rules wrt rcu and translation
units, I have not seen developers doing any additional analysis re
TUs, move code to separate files, nor I seen comments says that this
code must be in separate TU than that code. From what I see usually
it's assumed that things will just work. If anything LTO will be
useful to shake out latent bugs that will pop up later.
