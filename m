Currently, the ABI version (checksum) is stored outside of the actual 
code in the __ksymtab section. That means that the distributions can 
still apply upstream patches cleanly and only update the version 
checksum if these break ABI.

With the _v2, _v3 suffixes (or similar solutions) we'd be effectively 
storing the ABI versions directly in the code and that would cause 
conflicts when pulling further patches from upstream.

My view is that it would be than easier to maintain out-of-tree 
modversions (or similar tool) rather than to solve all these conflicts.

Warm Regards,
