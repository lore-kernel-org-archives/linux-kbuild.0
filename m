Okay. It would be good to get all the distros in on this.

What I want to do is work out exactly what it is that modversions is
giving you.

We know it's fairly nasty code to maintain and it does not detect ABI
changes very well. But it's not such a burden that we can't maintain
it if there are good reasons to keep it.

Basically vermagic is the string all modules and the kernel get, which
must match in order to load modules. If you have modversions disabled,
then vermagic includes the kernel version. If modversions is enabled,
then vermagic does not include the kernel version but the CRCs have to
also match.

Controlling it explicitly is just a couple of lines where a distro can
control it (so they can update their kernel version without breaking).
It's not meant to solve everything, just the first one.

I don't think that's necessary. A feature requirement for a distro is just
as valid as any other user of upstream. I don't want to hinder any distro,
I'm just still not quite seeing the big picture of exactly what functionality
you need from the kernel.

Thanks,
