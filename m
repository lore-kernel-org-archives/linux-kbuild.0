What you're saying is that you don't like the solution that's taken
weeks to get merged up to this point, so where do we go from here
now?  This crap has been broken since 4.9-rc1, and is a regression.

I think at this point, we just declare that modversions are broken
on ARM, and those who created this mess get to explain to people
why the fsck they broke the kernel.

4.9 is the next LTS kernel?  ROTFL!

I agree with Nicolas - it seems that the whole EXPORT_SYMBOL() crap
has just been a pointless exercise in churn, resulting only in
something "different" because it looks "cool" to do it some other
way.  There's no real benefit here at all, only harm.

Just revert the damned patches that created this breakage in the
first place please.  It's now way too late to be trying to fix it
any other way.
