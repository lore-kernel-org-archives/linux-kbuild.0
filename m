This is already covered by genksyms. Try make V=1 with
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y and add the -D option to one of the genksyms
command. I wanted to paste the expanded signature for
register_filesystem() as an example, but vger would probably drop the
mail for being too big :).

Right, this is something that genksyms has no idea about.
