Thank you both for the explanation!

It certainly is more useful as a test tool if the baseline is a
successful compile and link. Because you can have genuine link errors
due to missing symbols.

Good question. I myself always treated all{yes,mod}config as a build
test only and never dared to run it. Allyesconfig produces a giant
kernel image and allmodconfig builds binfmt_script as a module. And if
people used all*config for boot tests, they would probably be sending
patches to tweak the Kconfigs for that purpose. And this is not the case
as far as I can tell.

What you could do is to add a Kconfig option to arch/arm/Kconfig adding
-ffunction-sections to the compiler flags. Then allyesconfig would
select it and work around the problem in a somewhat elegant way.
