Will update and add better information.

OK, I'll remove the reference to .version_dtb.

This binding is kind of an odd ball to me.  It is clearly _not_ describing
hardware, which is really the central point of the dtb.  But the chosen
node is allowed to cover policy things like the boot command line.

So I would encourage a slightly unusual mind set when reviewing this
binding (not that I really know what that mind set is!).

The answer to the specific question of why add a "not well-defined"
binding is the same answer as to why have a kernel version string.
There was a proposal to remove the kernel version string and that
was quickly dropped.

I should have written more about why this is useful.

This binding provides the provenance of the DTB.  What source (and
version of the source) and version of the compiler (dtc) was used
to make the DTB.

If I want to debug DTB related issues, read the source that was used
to create the DTB, or slightly modify the DTB - where is the source
and what is the version of it in the source control system.

When building and installing a DTB, did the version that I wanted to
install on the target actually get on the target.

I will make the name more generic.

Paranoia.  Even if not probable, one could build different DTBs from
the same .dts.

Those are the forms of the path that are present in the build
system.  If there is a good reason to change one of them to the
other form, I could add the extra complexity to massage the path.

The absolute path tells you which source repository contained the source.
