This is simply how grep works though.

After you have gone through the extra layer of naming indirection
to work out what it is. I'm still not sold on the name indirection
and hiding wildcards. Not just for asm grepping, but I don't think
it's a negative thing for devs working on the linker to know what
actual section names and commands are being used, as much as possible.

OK.

This together with the "combined with .text" part confused me.

I still don't see this is better than

.text*
.text.*
.text.range.*
.text.table.*
etc.

I'm not sure, but I suspect it may have been due to . not being a valid C
symbol name. I'm not saying it's always the wrong thing to do, but I think
copy&paste and lack of documentation has left the naming conventions in
need of some love.

The section names themselves of course can and should have some greppable
distinguishing conventions -- we don't need macro name for that.

For me, DEFINE_SECTION_RANGE(kprobes, .text) would be fine.

Sure, but point taken it's more productive to discuss fundamentals
first. Let's consider exact details afterward.

It's not a big deal, so whatever suits you. Some of the bugfixes and
cleanups could be pushed through various arch and other maintainers
first too, which would make the core series look more managable and
touch fewer parts.

Oh, that makes more sense. The SECTION stuff and custom sections was
confusing me. I would prefer just to drop all the LINUX_SECTION naming
and make it match the functionality you're using. For example:

+DEFINE_LINKTABLE(struct jump_entry, __jump_table);
+
 /* mutex to protect coming/going of the the jump_label table */
 static DEFINE_MUTEX(jump_label_mutex);
 
@@ -274,8 +277,6 @@ static void __jump_label_update(struct static_key *key,

Now I think this is a fine abstraction to have. I think it would look
even cleaner if you had:

LINKTABLE_START(__jump_table)
LINKTABLE_END(__jump_table)

Then do we need to even have the LINUX_SECTION middle man at all?

Thanks,
Nick
