Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: provide THIN_ARCHIVES option for all architectures
Date: Mon, 29 May 2017 18:11:03 +1000

Supporting two different intermediate-artifact packaging schemes
was only ever intended as a temporary transition.

This has so far caused no problems for powerpc, after a small fix
for how the arch invoked ar. So now allow any arch to select the
option, continue defaulting to N.

The next step will be to have archs always select THIN_ARCHIVES
when they are known to work. Then remove the option entirely.

x86 has always just worked for me, so that should be easy.
