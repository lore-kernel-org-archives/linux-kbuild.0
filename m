Well we might have to. I couldn't make thick archives work easily
because we have multiple levels of built-in.o, and with thick you
get an archive of an archive which the linker does not understand.
Fixing that would mean unpacking the archive and repacking it for
every built-in.o input you link -- too painful.

I suspect Google uses the format internally too because they added
the initial support.

https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2008-03/msg00150.html

Support has been pervasively added to binutils -- nm, objdump, ld,
etc. I think it falls into the category of well supported.

Yeah I think it's reasonable to drop support for such old toolchain
if we have a reason for it.

I'll send a patch to 0day and if that passes, I'll see if it's
something Stephen would put into linux-next.

Thanks,
Nick
