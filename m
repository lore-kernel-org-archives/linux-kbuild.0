The goal was just to move .hot and .unlikely all together, so that
they are clustered and use the minimum amount of cache. On x86 doesn't
matter where they are exactly, as long as each is together.
If they are not explicitely listed then the linker interleaves
them with the normal text, which defeats the purpose.
