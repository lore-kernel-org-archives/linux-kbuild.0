Well, this is intended behavior for some definition of intended.
The root cause of what happened here is that syzbot has to disable
CONFIG_USBIP_VHCI_HCD/CONFIG_BT_HCIVHCI when it crosses v4.10
boundary. It fixes boot on the release and otherwise no bisection will
succeed at all.
It's just happened so that this particular bug is dependent on these
exact configs and was introduced before v4.10. So it was bisected to
v4.10. And in this sense it is working as intended.

How would you define intended bisection behavior for the situation
when kernel is build/boot/test broken most of the time, even on
releases and even on recent releases? ;)
I guess the 100% fair answer is "the bug happens as far as we could
test (which is not too far)". And that's what I did initially, but the
result was way less useful than what we have now.

This and other details of the process are described here:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md#bisection
This was the first attempt at giving more transparency into the process.

I see 2 potential improvements:
1. (simpler) noting in the bisection log things like disabled configs,
cherry-picked fixes and other things necessary to repair kernel.
2. (harder) try to figure out that the bug actually depends on the
disabled config
I've added this to https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/1051
But for (2) I would first like to see that this is a common enough
problem rather then a one-off thing, because it's easier to say than
to implement that reliably and this can affect bugs completely
unrelated to the disabled configs due to unavoidable kernel crash
flakes (and then somebody will need to explain what happened to all
people asking).

And obviously doing some real testing before merging each commit into
any kernel tree would help tremendously with bisection long term ;)

Even v5.0 is boot broken if I try to enable more configs. So we will
need to disable more configs in bisection in future as we onboard them
to syzbot. The current points in time we need to disable various
configs suspiciously resemble when they were added to syzbot config...
