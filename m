Yeah I wasn't suggesting that for 4.9, or 4.10 even.

alpha, m68k, s390, sparc, ia64 are affected and have no patch (or none
I've been cc'ed on) for asm-prototypes.h. Doesn't seem infeasible to add
them before 4.9, considering the fairly low risk of patch. Opt-in would
be pointless IMO, might as well just revert the arch part of Al's patch
instead.
