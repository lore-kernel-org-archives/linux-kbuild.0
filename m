Most of us get just a scary-looking warning, but whatever the problem is for
you, it's good to hear this patch works around it.

Whatever the long-term solution will be, for 4.10 an updated[1] version of
this fix is on kbuild/kbuild (and kbuild/for-next).  I guess we'll bother
stable@ once it is merged.

Note that it handles only x86, there's a bunch of other architectures
affected, alpha m68k s390 sparc ia64 might still need fixing.


Meow!

[1]. Turns out there was a missing symbol on 486; people build-test those
but don't try to actually boot, and even when they do, they don't read
warnings.
