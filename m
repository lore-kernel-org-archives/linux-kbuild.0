Well, genksyms does provide this today with the .symref files.  It may not
be as thorough and flexible as libabigail, but RH has been using it for
years to quickly determine what patches broke the abi and more importantly
where (which can be challenging).  I just didn't want to downplay what is
available today.

On the flip side, I do like what libabigail has to offer.  There seems to be
some interesting new ways of handling our abi and I look forward to our kabi
team putting it to use. :-)

I also don't want folks to forget that are two parts to this equation.  The
checking above is the first part.  But the second part is what to do about
the stuff you ignored, which leads to the run time checks.

If you don't maintain 100% abi (which RH doesn't), then we need a way to
block drivers from loading that use symbols which we do not maintain and
broke.  The crc checks at load time work great for this.  Hopefully we can
continue to support what modversions is providing today (or something
similar).

I do not think vermagic will be usable at all for us.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Don
