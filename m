Hi Tom,

Some nit picking on the patch comment.  :-)

Not just stacked overlays (I'm guessing by that you mean an
overlay applied on top of an overlay), but even an overlay on
top of the base dtb.

Not so much additional functionality within the kernel.  It is basic
functionality for any overlay to be applied in the kernel.

Thank you, that is very useful info to capture in the commit history.

If I understand correctly, then you are following Rob's suggestion of
passing the DTC_EXTRA_FLAGS value in the dtb make command.

That seems to be a reasonable approach for now.  Rob did mention that
he would like to remove the current hard coding of a base DTC_FLAGS
value, where several architectures initialize it with one of:

   DTC_FLAGS ?= -p 1024
   DTC_FLAGS := -p 1024

If those initializations can be removed, then we could just use
DTC_FLAGS in the make command, instead of adding DTC_EXTRA_FLAGS.
Can you discuss that option with Rob?  (Sorry Rob, I'll be off-grid
soon.)
