Well, I did try to stop it then too:

  b72e7464e4cf ("x86/uapi: Do not export <asm/msr-index.h> as part of the user API headers")

And yet this wankery trickled out to userspace anyway.

Well, if it were me, I'd still remove the header and see if anything
breaks.

If it does - which I doubt very much - we can do Christoph's idea of
leaving the current version of the header exported but then untangling
it from the whole uapi crap and use our own kernel version which we can
change as much as we can.

In the end of the day, it is a maintainer decision what's going to
happen.
