Understandable.

I'm suggesting that I primarily talk to hobbyists and tinkerers, and
occasionally forget there are people that have jtag access :-P

Right, it's intended as a replacement for APPENDED_DTB since it can
handle multiple dtbs (so you can do one multiplatform zImage), and you
can hack around custom vendor atags.  eg ethernet mac addresses, Thomas'
CP15 register base address hack, etc.  All that goodness without
polluting the kernel source.  :)

thx,

Jason.
