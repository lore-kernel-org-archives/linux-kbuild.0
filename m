Well that's really my point - do you actually /need/ to do that?

What headers would be in (b) but not (a)? We'd typically be defining
headers for the purpose of defining constants that are part of the
binding definitions. To keep the kernel and binding documents in sync,
the kernel should have access to any such header. Hence, I think the set
of headers only in (a) would be non-existent. Even if there are some,
presumably there would be so few it wouldn't actually matter if we
weeded them out.

The only exception I can think of right now is the header for the i.MX
pinctrl bindings, since that's expanding the names into a set of values
the kernel will use directly rather than as needing to use as table
indices. I'm not sure if that's the right way to go on the bindings; I
see you're getting some pushback. But, I guess "pinctrl-simple" would
end up in the same boat, so perhaps there's some argument for not
removing boot/dts/ itself from the include path.
