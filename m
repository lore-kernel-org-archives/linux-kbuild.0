[I've had to guess at the cc list for this, because we no longer have

This is roughly how Debian handles the kernel module=C2=A0ABI during a
stable release.

I agree with this. =C2=A0We can explicitly "version" individual symbols
anyway by doing something like:

-int foo(void);
+#define foo foo_2
+int foo_2(int);

Debian has some strong reasons:

1. Changing the release string requires any out-of-tree modules to be
upgraded (at least rebuilt) on end-user systems.  So we try to avoid
doing that during the lifetime of a stable release, i.e. we don't let
the release string change.  Also, the release string is reflected in
package names (e.g. linux-image-4.8.0-1-amd64), and introducing new
package names requires manual approval by the Debian archive team.

2. We want to allow ABI breaks for "internal" symbols used only by in-
tree modules, as those breaks will be resolved by rebooting to complete
the upgrade.  But we need a run-time check to prevent loading an
incompatible module before the reboot.

3. So far as I can see, module signing doesn't work for a distribution
kernel with out-of-tree modules as there has to be a trust path from a
built-in certificate to the module signing certificate.  So signature
enforcement will have to be disabled on systems that use out-of-tree
modules, thus it's not a substitute for modversions.

We expect Linux 4.9 to be the basis for a longterm stable branch and=C2=A0o=
n
that basis intend to include it in the next Debian stable release.=20
Even if the decision is to get rid of modversions, it would be very
helpful if they could be revived for 4.9 so that we have some time to
adapt our packaging practices to work without them in future.
