It's a valid concern.

At first I thought the first lines (see below) could have been useful
for userspace:

  #define CODA_PSDEV_MAJOR 67
  #define MAX_CODADEVS  5    /* how many do we allow */


But the file was unsuable for a long long time so we can assume it's
usage by userspace is deprecated, then we could remove it from UAPI,
and moves its content back to include/linux.

As one could see include/linux/coda_psdev.h is not used outside of
fs/coda, moving the header here as you suggests seems to be the correct
solution.

Regards.
