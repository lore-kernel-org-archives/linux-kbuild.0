Series looks good.

In several of your patches assignments are moved to the arch
specific uapi file, but the same assignment are already present in
include/uapi/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm so the assignment is redundant.

For example:
$ARCH uapi Kbuild:
generic-y += errno.h

uapi/asm-generic Kbuild:
mandatory-y += errno.h

As this patch-set is touching all arch files this
could be a good opportunity to clean this up too.

But maybe mandatory-y and generic-y do something different,
and both are needed. In wich cases all is good.
