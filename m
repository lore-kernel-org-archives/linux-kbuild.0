If there's no real good reason (brokenness) to deprecate gcc-4.1, I would not
do it.I guess most people using old compilers know what they're doing.

My main motivation for keep on using gcc-4.1 is that it gives many warnings
that were disabled in later gcc versions.  I do look at all new warnings, and
send patches when they are real bugs, or are trivial to silence.

Lately the usefulness has been decreasing, as you've been too aggressively
killing compiler warnings with recent gcc versions (which became better) ;-)
Hence if I detected a new warning with a point or an rc release, it usually
means the code was never in nex (ugh)t, or the maintainer ignored your patch.

I could easily switch to v4.9 from kernel.org crosstool, though, but then I
would loose all those warnings.

BTW, below is the diff I use to avoid an ICE.
After that, it builds and (test)boots fine on ARAnyM ;-)
