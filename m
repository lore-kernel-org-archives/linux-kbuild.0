Yea, many things would be nice, but I've been unable to track the
issues here - it really didn't help _not_ being copied on the
original set of patches which introduced this mess.

I've merged Nicolas' patch, so now we need to work out what to do
with the remaining bits - which I guess are the asm-prototypes.h
and the mmio* bits.  I'm not aware of what's happening with the
patches that they depend on (which is why I recently asked the
question - again, I seem to be completely out of the loop due to
lack of Cc's).

So I'm just throwing my hands up and saying "I don't know what to
do" at this stage.
