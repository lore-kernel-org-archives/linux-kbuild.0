Honestly, I lost track of wait exactly your point was. And, in my
opinion, Brendan has provided over and above the information required to
justify Kunit's inclusion.

From my perspective, once we were actually pointed to the in-kernel
kselftest code and took a look at it, it was clear there was no
over-arching framework to them and that Kunit could be used to
significantly improve those tests with a common structure. Based on my
reading of the thread, Ted came to the same conclusion.

I don't think we should block this feature from being merged, and for
future work, someone can update the in-kernel kselftests to use the new
framework.
