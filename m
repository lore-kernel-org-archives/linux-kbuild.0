Yes, that's a limitation. cpp expansion we can handle, but not gas macros.
You will need Arnd's patches for ARM.

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kbuild&m=147732160529499&w=2

If that doesn't fix it for you, send me your .config offline and I'll set
up a cross compile to work on it.

Again, any arch always has the option of going back to doing asm exports
in the old style of putting them into a .c file, but hopefully you'll find
Arnd's reworked patches to be something you're willing to merge.

Thanks,
Nick
