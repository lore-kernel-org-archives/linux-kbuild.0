Yes, but I build other samples selected with separate CONFIG_ options
like CONFIG_SAMPLE_LIVEPATCH. So this guy should have its own CONFIG_
option too, because I (and likely others) don't want to build it. All of
the samples should be protected at least by their respective kernel
CONFIG_ option IMO.

The output is this:
In file included from samples/kdbus/kdbus-workers.c:79:0:
/home/latest/linux/samples/kdbus/kdbus-api.h:5:25: fatal error:
linux/kdbus.h: No such file or directory
 #include <linux/kdbus.h>
                         ^
compilation terminated.

I now know that I have to install_headers *if* I want to build the
sample. But I don't want to build it in the first place. (So the config
option above should be all we need.)

Oh, it's cut&paste, I see. This does not look correct though. The hack
inclusive. Host progs are intended to be run on the host where the
kernel is built. During the compilation or such (like x/menuconfig).
Quite misleading naming if you are used to the autotools one.
