What is the benefit compared to wasting some memory for the directory?

I am pretty sure we allow empty attribute groups, so it is probbaly as
simple as removing "If (!params) return 0;" form
module_param_sysfs_setup() and making sure we always create
"parameters" group instead of doing it on first visible parameter in
add_sysfs_param(). I suppose we no longer want to skip over parameters
that are not readable nor writable either?

Thanks.
