I think, not. I don't have 4.7 around, but 4.9.3 has the issue if
-std=gnu99 is used.

5.4.1 builds kernel fine for me with allmodconfig (minus retpoline which
requires compiler support). Both -std=gnu99 and -std=gnu11.

Note that GCC has changed their version scheme. 5.4.1 is bug-fix release
of GCC-5.
