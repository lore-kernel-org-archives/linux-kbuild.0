That's not needed, and you are going to break the implicit ordering we
already have with link order.  You are going to have to figure out what
bus type the driver is, to determine what segment it was in, to figure
out what was loaded before what.

Not good.

There's no need to get rid of it, what are you trying to save here?  How
can you be sure init order is still the same?
