Actually, it just occurred to me that this code does not adhere 100%
to the kernel mode neon rules, by putting kernel_neon_begin/end and
the code itself into the same source file. At the time, it seemed
harmless, given that these functions are only exposed via function
pointers and never called locally, and the compiler cannot really
reorder the function calls with the asm block. However, under LTO this
all changes, and it is no longer guaranteed that the NEON registers
are only touched between the kernel mode neon begin/end calls.

So the correct way to fix this would be to move the asm into its own
.S file, and call it from between the kernel_mode_neon_begin/end
calls. That should also fix your compat issue.
