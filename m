Sorry about that, you had mentioned that you had used it recently, which should
have weighed more than my own results.

I must have done something wrong:

I tried a few defconfigs with a latest kernel and compiler and they all failed,
found linux-4.3 to be the first version that was broken for all of them
(most with a link time error, some with missing gcc features)

I later tried all mips defconfigs with linux-4.3 and they all failed
with gcc-4.1.3
but built fine with gcc-4.9. I've now tried decstation_defconfig in 4.8-rc11,
and this is what I see for gcc-4.1.3

So it still fails, but only because of one compiler error that I can avoid by
disabling that driver, and you probably use a slightly patched compiler
version that doesn't have this particular bug, or it was a regression between
gcc-4.1.2 and 4.1.3.
