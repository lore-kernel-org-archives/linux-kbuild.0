No need to keep this around, just in case someone steps up
to add support for these archs again.
There is no users so it will bit-rot over time anyway,
and will confuse new readers.
And if an arch shows up there is now a good incentive to
do what everyone else does, rather than having
special handling in the kernel.

Removing the symbol has the extra benefit that the kbuild
files becomes a little more readable, something we should
always welcome.

In other words - drop the symbol.
And well spotted!
