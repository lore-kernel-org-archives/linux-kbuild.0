That wouldn't work at all for structures that change, as we never
explicitly "mark" them for export anywhere.  You need a tool that looks
at either the source code (what we have today), or looks at the
object/debugging code (like the link I pointed at.)

I think we can live without asm functions changing their arguments as
that is usually very rare.  And maybe debugging info being a requirement
for those that want modversions (i.e. the distros), is ok as they
already generate that as part of their build.

But more importantly, that's a much longer-term solution, fixing what we
have today to at least start working again is much more important before
we start bikeshedding the whole mess :)
