I think there is some significant potential for improving performance.
Currently we have __tsan_read8 do 2 function calls, push/pop, the
second call is on unpredicted slow path.
Then __kcsan_check_watchpoint and __kcsan_setup_watchpoint do full
load of spills and lots of loads and checks that are not strictly
necessary or can be avoided. Additionally __kcsan_setup_watchpoint
calls non-inlined kcsan_is_atomic.
I think we need to try to structure it around the fast path as follows:
__tsan_read8 does no function calls and no spills on fast path for
both checking existing watchpoints and checking if a new watchpoint
need to be setup. If it discovers a race with existing watchpoint or
needs to setup a new one, that should be non-inlined tail calls to the
corresponding slow paths.
In particular, global enable/disable can be replaced with
occupying/freeing all watchpoints.
Per cpu disabled check should be removed from fast path somehow, it's
only used around debugging checks or during reporting. There should be
a way to check it on a slower path.
user_access_save should be removed from fast path, we needed it only
if we setup a watchpoint. But I am not sure why we need it at all, we
should not be reading any user addresses.
should_watch should be restructured to decrement kcsan_skip first, if
it hits zero (with unlikely hint), we go to slow path. The slow path
resets kcsan_skip to something random. The comment mentions
prandom_u32 is too expensive, do I understand it correctly that you
tried to call it on the fast path? I would expect it is fine for slow
path and will give us better randomness.
At this point we should return from __tsan_read8.

To measure performance we could either do some synthetic in-kernel
benchmarks (e.g. writing something to the debugfs file, which will do
a number of memory accesses in a loop). Or you may try these
user-space benchmarks:
