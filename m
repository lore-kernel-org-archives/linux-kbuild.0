Yes, it's always been just the assembly symbols that broke, these were
the ones that Al's original patch changed and that ended up with
no version information.

I have managed to bisect the link failure to a specific binutils
commit by Alan Modra now:

d983c8c ("Strip undefined symbols from .symtab")

went into binutils-2_26 and was reverted in 

a82e3ef ("Revert "Strip undefined symbols from .symtab"")

after the release branch for 2.26 was started, so that version
ended up being fine. However, the 2.27 version never saw the revert
and causes loadable kernel modules to become unusable when they refer
to a weak symbol in vmlinux. This works with 2.26 and lower:

$ nm obj-arm/vmlinux | grep __gnu_mcount_nc
         w __crc___gnu_mcount_nc
c031ed58 T __gnu_mcount_nc
c0ef4590 r __kcrctab___gnu_mcount_nc
c0efb4f5 r __kstrtab___gnu_mcount_nc
c0ee68bc R __ksymtab___gnu_mcount_nc

and this is breaks with 2.27 and higher:
$ make modules 2>&1 | tail -n 1
WARNING: "__gnu_mcount_nc" [drivers/ata/ahci_platform.ko] has no CRC!

$ nm obj-arm/vmlinux | grep __gnu_mcount_nc
c031ed58 T __gnu_mcount_nc
c0ef4590 r __kcrctab___gnu_mcount_nc
c0efb4f5 r __kstrtab___gnu_mcount_nc
c0ee68bc R __ksymtab___gnu_mcount_nc

Applying the patch below on top of today's binutils master branch
makes it work again. The real patch will also have to fix the testsuite.
