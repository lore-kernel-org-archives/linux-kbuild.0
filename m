It is exported because it is listed in arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild:
header-y += msr-index.h (see also patch #4).

I understand your concerns but my patch does not change anything. And I think
David's comment is right: if I remove it, I break the uapi.

After digging a bit, it seems you have already tried to remove it in commit
b72e7464e4cf ("x86/uapi: Do not export <asm/msr-index.h> as part of the user API
headers"), but because this file is still listed in the Kbuild file, it is still
exported.

It would be great if we could find a consensus about what to do with this file
because it blocks patch #4 and the rest of the series.


Thank you,
Nicolas
