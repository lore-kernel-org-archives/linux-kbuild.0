The _v2 and _v3 functions are probably the ones that also get used by
future backports in the distro kernel itself and are probably the reason
for the ABI change in the first place. Thus going down this route will
basically require distros to touch every future backport patch and will
in general generate a big mess internally.

I think it is important to keep versioning information outside of the
source code. Some kind of modversions will still be required, but
distros should be able to decide if they put in some kind of checksum or
a string, what suites them most.

Thanks,
Hannes (who is still impressed by the genksyms tools)
