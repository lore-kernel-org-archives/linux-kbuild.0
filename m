   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
11655078	6018736	 418944	18092758	11412d6	vmlinux.inclink
11655078	6018736	 418944	18092758	11412d6	vmlinux.inclink.clk
11650534	6010288	 418616	18079438	113dece	vmlinux.thinarc
11650534	6010288	 418616	18079438	113dece	vmlinux.thinarc.clk

Same result for me when compiling defconfig minus MACH_SUN8I, comparing
+/- the clock patch and thin archives. No size savings. As I explained
already, I really can't see how there could be any saving if the lib.a is
incrementally linked into built-in.o.
