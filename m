I disagree (also see below).  The armksyms way was understandable.
The new way... I've no idea yet, because I wasn't even copied on
any of the patches.  I've no idea how the exports are now handled.
I'm in a black hole with respect to that, and that's now a problem.

Yes, but I'm not on linux-kernel-v2, and I've no desire to end up with
another list I've no hope of keeping up with to my mailbox - I'll just
ignore it.  99% of the messages on it at the time when vger kicked me
off the list was x86 related discussion, and not really cross-arch
issues.  As I say, it just became another linux-kernel list.

Well, there's more problems with this new KSYMS approach than just the
CRCs.  It forces a rebuild of the ksyms files every single time, which
then causes a relink of the kernel:
