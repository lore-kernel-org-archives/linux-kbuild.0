Thank you for doubling back around to this but we are good here. These
warnings have all been fixed in Linus' tree without the need for the
first patch in the series.

For those curious:

63174f61dfaef ("kernel/extable.c: use address-of operator on section symbols")
bf2cbe044da27 ("tracing: Use address-of operator on section symbols")
8306b057a85ec ("lib/dynamic_debug.c: use address-of operator on section symbols")
b0d14fc43d392 ("mm/kmemleak.c: use address-of operator on section symbols")
afe956c577b2d ("kbuild: Enable -Wtautological-compare")

Cheers,
Nathan
