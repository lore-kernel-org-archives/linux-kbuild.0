The last time I looked, RHEL and SLE did.  They change the release
string for each new kernel version, but they will copy/link old out-of-
tree modules into the new version's "weak-updates" module subdirectory
if the symbol versions still match.

Allowing the vermagic to be changed separately doesn't help us, as we
already control the release string.  If we were to change some of the
module tools to consider vermagic then it would allow us to report the
full version in the release string while not forcing rebuilds on every
kernel upgrade - but that's not a pressing problem.

One thing that could work for us would be:

- Stricter version matching for in-tree modules (maybe some extra
  part in vermagic that is skipped for out-of-tree modules)
- Ability to blacklist use of a symbol, or all symbols in a module,
  by out-of-tree modules

where the blacklist would be a matter of distribution policy.  But this
would still require a fair amount of work by someone, and I doubt you'd
want this upstream.

If this was just about non-free modules I wouldn't care.  There are
also many freely licenced out-of-tree modules that for various reasons
don't get submitted or accepted upstream; also backports of new or
updated drivers.
