How would that work for structures?  Would that be required for every
EXPORT_SYMBOL* somehow?

There are tools that people are working on to make it more obvious where
API breaks happen by looking at the .o debug data instead of our crazy
current system (which is really better than nothing), perhaps we should
start using them instead?

See here for more details about this:
