I think that's fine, a couple were already picked up, and what I have
left now is

a281bfa5713a [SUBMITTED 20160615] [EXPERIMENTAL] Kbuild: enable -Wmissing-include-dirs by default
83934921e68e [SUBMITTED 20160615] rtlwifi: don't add include path for rtl8188ee
5664e7bb88a8 [SUBMITTED 20160615] drm: amd: remove broken include path
e6d3cf76f9f8 [SUBMITTED 20160615] ARM: hide mach-*/ include for ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M
b21947dbd792 [SUBMITTED 20160615] ARM: don't include removed directories

I can probably put the last two into arm-soc directly. After that, we'd
be left with a very small diff for the series:

I have only tested this on arm, arm64 and x86, so I don't know if that
introduces new warnings, but we could ask Andrew if he wants to add that
to linux-mm after the merge window.
