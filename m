You got it about right.

Yeah... Benefit being it's very simple and everybody can see exactly
what it does and knows how it will work.

This is something I've noticed. Would it be better if the module loader
ignores the kernel version and instead used some internal ABI version
string to check against? Otherwise (AFAICT) you always have 4.8.0 versions
despite being 4.8.7 kernel, and you can't upgrade a point release without
overwriting your old kernel and modules.

That is something we could potentially replace modversions with. It would
be a far more reasonable complexity to carry for downstream distros than
modversions. Though not something we can add for 4.9.

It would be nice to get upstream to the point where 4.9 modversions
works if you just patch out depends BROKEN. That would require reverting
a few more of Al's arch patches.

Then in 4.10 we can re-add all those arch patches (which are less
controversial without the asm-prototypes.h workaround), and implement a
simple stable ABI version string check, and then in 4.11 we can remove
modversions.

Thanks,
Nick
