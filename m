The case is:

Build 1 runs with CCACHE_HARDLINK enabled.
- Each object ccache creates will be stored in ccache, and hard linked
  into the throw-away object tree.
- recordmcount modifies in-place the object in the object tree, which
  also modifies the object in the ccache repository.

The throw-away object tree is thrown away, and a new tree is created,
and the build re-run.  It doesn't matter what CCACHE options are used,
the effect will now be the same:
- Each "hit" ccache object from the previous build will be linked or
  copied to the new throw-away object tree.
- recordmcount will be re-run on the object, which now contains the
  results of the previous recordmcount in-place modification.  This
  causes recordmcount to issue a warning.

There's two solutions to this: one is to disable CCACHE_HARDLINK for
all kernel builds which use in-place object modification.  The other
solution is to avoid in-place object modification, instead doing a
read-write-rename.

I think I ought to ask another question though, before we decide what
to do.  With recordmcount doing in-place object modification, what
happens if a SIGINT or similar is received half way through the
modification of an object?  I would hope that make would delete the
object and not leave it around.

Another suggestion - maybe recordmcount, which fstat()s the file,
should check the st_nlink before modifying the file, and error out
with a helpful error message telling people not to use hardlinks,
which would stop nasty surprises (and make it a rule that this should
be implemented as a general principle for good build behaviour) - iow,
something like this (untested):
