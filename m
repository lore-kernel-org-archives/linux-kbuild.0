I always reject any set variable to zero (or mark it uninitialised) just
because gcc warns patches precisely because they would hide future
errors; all the checkers we care about have a false positive matching
system now.  The thing this would cut down on is the number of newbie "I
compiled the kernel myself and this fixes the warning I found" type
patches, which I do see as a net benefit.
