See https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2016-01/msg00118.html thread
for discussion on why the patch was reverted for 2.26.  At the time I
believed that only the ppc64 kernel was affected, by a weak undefined
"__crc_TOC." disappearing.  Am I correct in thinking that remained
true up until Linus' merge commit 84d69848c9 2016-10-14?

As far as reverting the binutils commit goes, I'm quite willing to do
that if necessary.  You can see how important I think the fix was by
viewing https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4317 and
noticing that the bug was reported in 2007 and didn't see any action
for 8 years..
