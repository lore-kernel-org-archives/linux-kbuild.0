Thanks for your review, and you have a good point.

If neither arch-own header implementation is found
nor generic-y is specified, the build system can automatically generate
generic wrappers for "mandatory" headers.

I also considered of it, but I wanted to take my time.

I simply moved generic-y without introducing any logical change
in order to make this series less controversial.

One point of forcing explicit generic-y might be,
to give arch maintainers an opportunity to judge
if falling back to asm-generic one works or not.
