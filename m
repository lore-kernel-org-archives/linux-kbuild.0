The reasoning in b72e7464e4cf was valid then and is valid now. This
thing should not have been exported in the first place. And it's not
like I didn't try then. Dammit!

I know, we should not ever break userspace but if it were me, I'd remove
that export and see what breaks. If at all.

But let's see what the others think first.
