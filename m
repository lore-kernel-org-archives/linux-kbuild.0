Yes.

If the idea is to use it only/mostly with automated build tools, then
the better would be to call it only when explicitly requested, e. g.
something like C=3, in order to avoid breaking the usecase where one
would run its own script.

On my case, I use C=1 CHECK=compile_checks as part as my usual patch
handling. For every patch I apply on media, I call make again, to be
sure that no warning/building errors were added, not only with gcc
but also with smatch and sparse.
