Ah, indeed.

Right, and that makes it identical to the assembly case.

Yes, it does.

The problem I was alluding to has to do with symbols generated by the 
linker directly which for some reason behaves differently in that case.

Well, strictly speaking, if scripts/gen_ksymdeps.sh fails and its output 
isn't appended at all to the .*.cmd file, then that .*.cmd file is 
already corrupted as it is missing necessary dependencies. Would be 
better to delete the .*.cmd file entirely in that case.
