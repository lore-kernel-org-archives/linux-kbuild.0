That's about right. My patch *should* be a noop by itself (just provides the
framework for x86 fix to work). So if you notice any new breakage let me
know.

Yep, not ideal. I have a patch or so which is supposed to make CRC failure
warnings more reliable.

But still, modversions is pretty complicated for what it gives us. It sends
preprocessed C into a C parser that makes CRCs using type definitions of
exported symbols, then turns those CRCs into a linker script which which is
used to link the .o file with. What we get in return is a quite limited and
symbol "versioning" system.

What if we ripped all that out and just attached an explicit version to
each export, and incompatible changes require an increment? Google tells me
Linus is not a neutral bystander on the topic of symbol versioning, so I'm
bracing for a robust response :) (actually I don't much care either way, I'm
happy to put a couple of bandaids on it and keep it going)

Thanks,
Nick
