This doesn't depend on anything. Not sure what is all the fuss about
-- people got confused into thinking we had to drop a patch for some
reason. As explained in the first email, I simply rebased v5 (which is
based on top of rcX) to resolve the conflict myself (i.e. it does
*not* depend on changes in -next). If you are the one solving
conflicts yourself (which is what I asked in my second email), there
is no problem to begin with; I will simply send v6 to you and we are
done.

When I sent the first email, I assumed that changes in -next were
supposed to be clean -- my mistake, but please document somewhere how
-next works! Specially that you are rerere'ing conflicts and
re-resolving them every day.

Then the discussion shifted to what to do with changes that actually
depend on other changes.

Cheers,
Miguel
