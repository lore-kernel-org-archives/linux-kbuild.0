That is no longer a kernel config/build issue if you the system 
integrator put an XIP kernel on a target with the wrong DT.

The XIP kernel does require that you provide the actual memory base 
address as a constant to the build system but that could be extracted 
directly from the DT data if having a kconfig prompt for that is too 
unwieldy. The new kconfig macro language in mainline could even be 
leveraged to do that at config time.

All that is possible already. But config symbol mutual exclusion is not.
