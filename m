Well, the module arrives at the objects one way or another via an exported
symbol. Although it can be by following a lot of pointers so yes it's
probably near impossible to do well.

What we have today only looks at the type of the exported function or
variable I think (or does it? I didn't look that far into the parser).
Does not follow down all possible derivable pointer types.

Maybe. I'd like to know how people really care about it. Linus post from

http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/modversions.html

Seem to be that he just likes it to prevent module loading if the git version
is not available. Fair usage, but could we do better with less effort? Maybe
ship with a source version that can do the same job. If you take care of that
case, then what is left?

Oh yeah, we're fixing it. I just thought I'd bring it up since I have a few
important ears :)

Thanks,
