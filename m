Sorry, no. I've only had a little time to look at the errors
reported. Some of them seem to be noise, because there are
structures that have a handful of members where one of the
members points to an __init function or piece of data that is
only used in __init code. We would need to mark these structures
as __ref or write more complicated section mismatch checking code
to be silent in these cases.
