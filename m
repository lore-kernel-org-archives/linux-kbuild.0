I think this is subject to getting optimised out by newer gccs, since
it sees the START(tbl) and END(tbl) symbols as two completely
different arrays. See the short discussion here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/6/26/73 (the first attempt is wrong, so
don't look at that)

It is possible that < is different from != and always does the right
thing, but I haven't checked.

I have a WIP branch that converts most of the existing tables in the
kernel to use the external_array() macro which makes gcc throw away
any knowledge it had about a pointer being part of an array.
