Definitely.

when cross compiling, we are a bit between a rock and a hard place with
the sample userspace programs:
- The target toolchain might not have libc support
- The host toolchain might be lacking recent kernel headers (therefore
  the need to do make headers_install)
- It's not clean whether the samples are meant to be ran on the build
  host or target.

There has been some work by Sam Ravnborg to introduce uapiprogs-y to for
sample userspace programs, but for now, please use hostprogs-y,
-Iusr/include and make each sample opt-in.
