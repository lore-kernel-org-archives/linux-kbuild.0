The thing is - to maintain an ABI version string, you need some level of
certainty that two given ABIs are really interchangeable. Which means
you need to check whether the symbols _and_ types exposed are unchanged.
Which is a thing that genksyms, the tool behind CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, does
quite well. So yes, you could do a testbuild with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
and a production build with some global ABI string, but what's the point
then.

I'd rather change the kconfig to

depends on BROKEN || <archs that have asm/asm-prototypes.h>

and eventuallly remove the dependency again. PPC has the header already,
so it can be added right away. I do not know why the x86 patch has not
been merged yet.
