Even if J is not specified, then it still runs with the maximum number of
threads:

Coccinelle parallelization
---------------------------

By default, coccicheck tries to run as parallel as possible.

Indeed, J= does set the number of threads speficied.

OK.  I tried a simple make coccicheck -j4 and indeed it does not seem to
be complaining.  The number of spatch processes goes over 160 though.
