Subject: [PATCH v2 00/28] kbuild: complete UAPI de-coupling and cleanup scripts/Makefile.headersinst
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2017 03:32:32 +0900

In v4.12-rc1, we had a big progress for headers_install.
All (and only) headers under UAPI directories are exported.
However, asm-generic wrappers are still exceptions because
most of arch/*/include/asm/Kbuild include "generic-y" for
exported headers.  As a result, many of generic-wrappers to be
exported are generated outside UAPI directories.

To finish de-coupling UAPI, "generic-y" for exported headers
should be moved to arch/*/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild.

With those cleanups, the logic of headers_install will become
even simpler.  UAPI will be completely self-contained.

This series is based on:
commit 19bf2e0ef18ec8a7284ecc83459a2664cb885cd5

Changes for v2:
  - rebase on the latest in the mainline in order to avoid merge conflicts
