Sure. This is something an automated checker can't solve completely.
Any changes would have to be considered in terms of their impact to
the ABI. It's not just data but also instruction changes involved.

This is policy that should not be mandated by the kernel. Which is
why I'm in favor of using tools like this and just providing mechanism
so distros can implement their own polices.

I think that's SRCVERSION which is something else. But modversions
has problems too.

Would be good to get a consensus on that too.
