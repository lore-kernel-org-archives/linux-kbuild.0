Commit 9ccd608070b6 "arm64: dts: add device tree for ARM SMM-A53x2 on
LogicTile Express 20MG" added a new dts file to arch/arm64 which
included "../../../../arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi", i.e. a
.dtsi supplied by arch/arm.

Unfortunately this causes some issues for the split device tree
repository[0], since things get moved around there. In that context
the new .dts ends up at src/arm64/arm/vexpress-v2f-1xv7-ca53x2.dts
while the include is at src/arm/vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi.

The sharing of the .dtsi is legitimate since the baseboard is the same
for various vexpress systems whatever processor they use.

Rather than using ../../ tricks to pickup .dtsi files from another
arch this patch creates a new directory include/dt-dtsi as a
home for such cross-arch .dtsi files, arranges for it to be in the
include path when the .dts files are processed by cpp and switches the
.dts files to use cpp #include instead of /include/. The dtsi file
itself is moved into a vendor subdir in this case "arm" (the vendor,
not the ARCH=).
