Subject: [RFC-b PATCH] kbuild: redefine __FILE__ as relative path from $(srctree) if possible

Since Kbuild runs in the objtree, __FILE__ can be a very long path
depending of $(srctree).

Commit 9da0763bdd82 ("kbuild: Use relative path when building in a
subdir of the source tree") made the situation better for cases
where objtree is a child of srctree.  ($(srctree) is "..")

For other cases of out-of-tree build, filenames in WARN_ON() etc.
are still an absolute path.  It also means the kernel image depends
on where it was built.

Here, the idea is to redefine __FILE__ as the relative path from
$(srctree), but doing so causes a compiler warning:
  warning: "__FILE__" redefined [-Wbuiltin-macro-redefined]

We can suppress it with -Wno-builtin-macro-redefined.  However,
this option is not recognized by old compilers.  So, __FILE__
is re-defined only when the option is supported.

I am adding stringify helper because '"..."' wrapping is the same
pattern as in KBUILD_BASENAME, KBUILD_MODNAME.

Please note __FILE__ is always an absolute path for external
modules.  We can strip KBUILD_EXTMOD from the path if we want,
but I am not doing that.  It would make it difficult to figure out
the module in question in case of WARN_ON().

This is another possible approach.

Please see these as well:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9693559/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9693563/

Pro:
this is only touching 3 makefiles.

Con:
this does not work for old compilers.
