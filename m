I think Dan meant too simply not touch anything (i.e. not losing the
warning anywhere).

Hm... that means they don't support (by default) the same regexps as
GCC; which is bad: it means that it is only equivalent to the most
relaxed level in gcc, 1:

    """
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=1 matches .* regular expression, any
comment is used as fallthrough comment.
    """

    See https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html

i.e. any other level above will either not match Eclipse or not match gcc.

It shouldn't according to the standard -- but who knows... :-)

Eclipse understanding [[fallthrough]] is very good, actually.

Bad, but I guess they will add it to C eventually, since it is
probably coming for C2x.

clang does it if you enable -fdouble-square-bracket-attributes (please
see my other messages). gcc will at some point (if C2x gets the
attributes), but at the moment the C parser is different than the C++
parser and there is no support for it on trunk that I could see, so
they will have to copy the support; i.e. it will take a bit more time
than clang, likely.

Thanks a *lot* for taking a look at Eclipse!

Cheers,
Miguel
