The .symvers produced by the current scheme aren't completely useless
from this PoV, although they aren't ideal since you need both before an
d after trees and if the changes are large or far reaching the diff can
get a bit unwieldy, so better tooling which points directly to the
actual relevant change would be no bad thing.
