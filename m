Nothing, of course ;-)

It's the the starting point for this PoC. The idea actually is doing
this for all other driver types, too (eg. spi, pci, usb, ...). But
they'll need their own tables, as different *_register() functions have
to be called - just haven't implemented that yet.

That would be nice, but, unfortunately, we have lots of devices which
aren't attached to any (probing-capable) bus. That's why we have things
like oftree, etc.

The idea is getting rid of all the init code, which all just does the
same, just calls some *_register() function.
