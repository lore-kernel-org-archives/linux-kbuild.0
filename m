Oh, by [0] __GCC_STDC_INLINE__ is indeed actually the correct symbol
to check for.  Clang does support that, so nothing to fix there.

Neat, I'll have to bookmark that incantation.  I can s/gcc/clang/ to
get a similar list (which is how I know it supports
__GCC_STDC_INLINE__).

Patch now becomes something like:

#ifdef __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__
#define __gnu_inline __attribute__((gnu_inline))
#else
#define __gnu_inline
#endif

#define inline inline __attribute__((always_inline, unused)) notrace
__gnu_inline
...

Issues with that approach?
