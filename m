Yes, me neither, of course. I just would favor to get away with the
scripting if possible. ;)

Given how genksyms works right now, I would say quite frequently. I
would even go that far to say that every larger backport I had to deal
with in networking had those problems because of some very important top
level structs that make everything reachable (struct net_device or
struct sock), so each change to those structs basically cause a kabi change.

Even if we replace padding in a structure we added before a release,
this is actually considered a kabi breakage, we must annotate this
appropriately because of genksyms.

E.g. I also thought about reordering the structs. As already discussed
in this thread, genksyms takes ordering of its definition vs.
declarations into account, e.g.:

struct foo;
struct bar {
	struct foo *f;
};
<< private >>
struct foo {
};

wouldn't actually include struct foo as part of the symvers, but the
other way around it would.

Instead of burden upstream with this kind of reordering, a suppression
engine would be favored by me which we can drive by review and
discussions. Thus upstream doesn't have any burden on that, but it is
solely the burden of the distributions, where the burden belongs. ;)

The possibilities I see right now:

* we leave genksyms where it is for the time being and add a KCONFIG
knob to be able to call a replacement tool with well formed command line
syntax and stdout semantics.

* we import one of the alternatives instead of genksyms if it fits to
the kernel. I am still a bit concerned about differences in dwarf vs.
source code parsing. In the past I had twice bugs in dwarf generation,
but this probably can be dealt with, but just needs a bit more
experience in my opinion.

* we remove genksyms and just use one versioning vector for upstream but
still allow some kind of modversions per symbol being loaded from a
third party program like kabi-dw or libabigail.

Personally, because I see genksyms working quite well right now, I would
stick to it until we (the distributions) came to a conclusion.

Bye,
Hannes
