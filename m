Erratum 657417 is worked around by the linker by inserting additional
branch trampolines to avoid problematic branch target locations. This
results in much higher linking time and presumably slower and larger
generated code. The workaround also seems to only be required when
linking thumb2 code, but the linker applies it for non-thumb2 code as
well.

The workaround today is left to the linker to apply, which is overly
conservative.

https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2009-05/msg00297.html

This patch adds an option which defaults to "y" in cases where we
could possibly be running Cortex A8 and using Thumb2 instructions.
In reality the workaround might not be required at all for the kernel
if virtual instruction memory is linear in physical memory. However it
is more conservative to keep the workaround, and it may be the case
that the TLB lookup would be required in order to catch branches to
unmapped or no-execute pages.

In an allyesconfig build, this workaround causes a large load on
the linker's branch stub hash and slows down the final link by a
factor of 5.
