This is something I tried earlier, and it wasn't pretty: Some of the assembler
files rely on -D__ASSEMBLER__  to be set in order to read the right headers,
but setting that macro means that all of the declarations get skipped.

I ended up testing for -D__GENKSYMS__ in each .S file, which was also
rather ugly.
