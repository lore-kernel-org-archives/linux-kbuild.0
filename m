I think there's a much better way to solve this.

How about we have an architecture-defined way to provide all*config
with a set of settings to be used with Kconfig to define these
integer settings, rather than papering over the problem making up
random addresses (like you're doing for the debug stuff.)  Eg,
a default architecture-provided setting for KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG
that defines things such as the physical offset and the debug
addresses to be used for all*config targets?

Surely that's better than hacking around with the Kconfig files
trying to frig something into working, which can potentially confuse
people.
