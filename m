I think that moving the generated files to a common location
makes a lot of sense, but it seems easier to move them
to include/generated/linux/ or even to (generated/linux/) and
then add -Iinclude/generated/ to the gcc command line so
you don't need to actually change all the users.

For the files in asm/, you could either add a generated/asm
directory or move them to generated/linux/ and change the
users.
