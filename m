The only valid reason I can come up with is that it is simpler
to build a list of .o files than it is to generate a number
of thin archives.

I persuaded "linker scripts" mainly because I had the patch floating
and I was triggered by the powerpc discussions to resurface it again.

You are likely not alone here.
Unless someone else comes up with any good reason lets stay with
thin archives.
