No, because C++ is the driving force for the standard attributes
syntax; i.e. C2x is adding them because of the syntax published by
C++17; and possibly gcc 7.1 added support for fallthrough (and comment
parsing) due to C++17 too.

Basically, it is a small paragraph explaining how this came to be.

No, is it the correct format because we cannot add support for the
other syntax in gcc; so the best way to proceed is to simply wait
until clang supports the GNU attribute in C mode.

The tooling, of course, is another matter and independent of this.

Yes, I already said I would write it in one of the other threads.

Who said we aren't going to do it? :-)

I was actually in the process of checking which OSS tools supported
what and how easy it was to fix in each of them (gcc's [[...]] syntax,
clang's GNU and C++ attrs in C mode, cppcheck's fallthrough
support...), but it takes time; I prefer to do the research
beforehand; so that the submitted bug reports are better/more
precise/more helpful, etc.

However, you already sent the LLVM report (without mentioning this
thread or me, nor the -fdouble-square-bracket-attributes clang flag
that I mentioned). That is a bit rude :-) Please take things a little
easier, there is no need to rush stuff. If I didn't have submitted the
LLVM bug report is because I hadn't finish looking at the issue. In
general, I think it is polite (and also more productive to avoid
duplicating efforts) to first ask whoever is working on something
before you rush to do it...

gcc 7.1 started everything. It is stated in the commit message and
several messages/threads already. Again, please pause, relax and read
a bit before sending stuff around :-)

Cheers,
Miguel
