Right, makes sense. The linker error actually shows this quite clearly,
though I wonder why I never saw that with my LD_DCDE patch.
It's possible that the sections were always small enough in that
case, but there is probably something else going on as well.

I'd like to end up with a version that lets me build randconfig kernels
without warnings or errors (probably keeping LD_DCDE enabled
is sufficient). I have to think about that some more, but for now
this doesn't seem like a reason against doing THIN_ARCHIVES
in mainline for ARM.
