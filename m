As I have read, -next is supposed to be a vision of what the merge
window will look like after merging everything, i.e. ideally -rc1. For
that to work for files out-of-tree (like these ones, which are not
maintained by a single tree), changes should be allowed to be stacked
on each other; otherwise, we cannot handle conflicts :-(

Not sure what you mean by "drop that patch". There is no patch to
drop, there is a conflict with a change already in -next.

Cheers,
