I tested -std=gnu99 for ARM
with pre-built Linaro toolchains.


GCC 4.9.4 was NG,
GCC 5.3.1 was OK.



If we increase the minimal GCC version,
we might end up with dropping more architecture.

I can no longer get the toolchains for hexagon, unicore32.


https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/
provides hexagon compilers, but only for GCC 4.6.1
