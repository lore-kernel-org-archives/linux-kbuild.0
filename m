Sorry for these fairly nonsensical comments.  make -j is going to consider
every file, then parse and run every semantic patch on that file.  If the
parallelism is pushed down into Coccinelle, each semantic patch will be
parsed only once, and then Coccinelle will choose the files for which it
is relevant.  If indexing is used (idutils, glimpse), then for semantic
patches that focus on specific keywords, Coccinelle will efficiently
ignore files that are not relevant.  I don't think there would be many
cases where make -j would win.  Perhaps it would be possible to detect
its used and abort with an appopriate message?
