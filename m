It's certainly not an option for v4.9 at this point. There is also no
realistic way we can get a correct asm/asm-prototypes.h for all the
other architectures in place. At the moment, powerpc is the only
one that actually works with modversions.

We can either make CONFIG_MODVERSIONS a per-architecture opt-in
and let only the ones that have the header file select that, or
revert all of Al's original patches that moved the exports.
