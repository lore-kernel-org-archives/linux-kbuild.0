Thank you for the post. I ran it through 0day and found some issues
with a few archs that I'm working through. Some changes are needed to
the generic thin archives build scripts, and some arch tweaks required.
So it's not 100% trivial.

4.13 might still be a realistic target if I make some progress.

Thanks,
Nick
