It seems that due to spinlock_debug.c containing data races, the console
gets spammed with reports. However, it's also possible to encounter
deadlock, e.g.  printk lock -> spinlock_debug -> KCSAN detects data race
-> kcsan_print_report() -> printk lock -> deadlock.

So the best thing is to fix the data races in spinlock_debug. I will
send a patch separately for you to test.

The issue that lockdep still reports inconsistency in IRQ flags tracing
I cannot yet say what the problem is. It seems that lockdep IRQ flags
tracing may have an issue with KCSAN for numerous reasons: let's say
lockdep and IRQ flags tracing code is instrumented, which then calls
into KCSAN, which disables/enables interrupts, but due to tracing calls
back into lockdep code. In other words, there may be some recursion
which corrupts hardirqs_enabled.

Thanks,
