Loading the device tree at a different address should be easy.  You just 
need to load it at the top of RAM. You may also start by attempting to 
boot a plain Image (uncompressed) kernel binary.

I'm using -ffunction-sections as well for the kernel size reduction work 
I'm currently doing.  The linker script has to be adapted so .text.* is 
specified along .text otherwise those functions end up appended at the 
end of the binary.
