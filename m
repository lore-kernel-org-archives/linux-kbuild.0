No, this is not what I meant.

What I want to say is:
All the host tools used for building vmlinux should be located in the
directory "scripts/",
but the directory may also other host tools that are not used for
building vmlinux (such as checkpatch).

With my suggestion "scripts/gcc-plugins/",
the sub-directory name describes it very well.

In my understanding, they are plug-in'ed into the cross-compiler that
compiles vmlinux.

If so, GCC plugins should be happy in "scripts/"
because Kbuild descends into "scripts/" before building any objects for vmlinux.
