Ok.

I'd recommend dropping that -Werror from mips and the other few
architectures that have it, or maybe wrapping it in a Kconfig symbol that
is disabled by default. It would also take care of
==> build/mips/bmips_be_defconfig/log <==
cc1: warnings being treated as errors
/git/arm-soc/arch/mips/bmips/setup.c:37: error: integer constant is
too large for 'long' type

As mentioned, we can also turn off the warnings by default and let
Geert turn them on again:

I've built the remaining defconfigs in the meantime (linux-4.11-rc8, gcc-4.1.3,
ARCH=mips) and got 38 builds with warnings and 20 failed builds. There are
at least six different build failures and only one ICE among them (only
in decstation_defconfig). With gcc-4.3 this is only slightly better: 18
failed build, 20 with warnings and 20 without warnings.

With linux-4.3, I saw this failure on 32 defconfigs,
and you fixed that in linux-4.7 with e49d38488515 ("MIPS: MSA: Fix a
link error on `_init_msa_upper' with older GCC"):

arch/mips/built-in.o: In function `enable_restore_fp_context':
traps.c:(.text+0xbefc): undefined reference to `_init_msa_upper'
traps.c:(.text+0xbfc0): undefined reference to `_init_msa_upper'

With gcc-4.9, all mips defconfigs now build without warnings.

For the other architectures in linux-4.11-rc8 can actually build with
sparc-gcc-4.1, afaict this was a bug that impacted all compilers up to
gcc-4.7 and a workaround was added recently. In turn, parisc-gcc-4.1
no longer works on linux-4.11, so we still have only three architectures
that can build their 'defconfig' with the old compiler, plus the majority
of the mips config files.

So while overall I still think that gcc-4.1 is rather broken, it seems that
you have it well under control on both mips and m68k. It's possible
that some other people use patched gcc-4.1 or only build special
configurations on further architectures that I found to be broken
with vanilla toolchains and the regular defconfig.

How about this approach then:

- To keep it simple, we update the README.rst to say that a minimum
  gcc-4.3 is required, while recommending gcc-4.9 for all architectures
- Support for gcc-4.0 and earlier gets removed from linux/compiler.h,
  and instead we add a summary of what I found, explaining that
  gcc-4.1 has active users on a few architectures.
- We make the Makefile show a warning once during compilation for
  gcc earlier than 4.3.
