I have nothing against it if you want to clean it up. You're the
maintainer so whatever you prefer :)

Yes it seems to be quite successful. ARM and MIPS people are looking
at it, I have it working for powerpc and x86 quite easily. I will
send patches to arch maintainers if we get these thin archives changes
merged in the next window.

Yes I think it should be no longer necessary.

The only problem with LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION is that it overloads
elf section names to pass data to the linker, so it's not 100% transparent.
In practice it's been very minor changes. On balance it will end up being
better than a whole lot of conditional compiling and linking workarounds
such as the one you mention below.

Yes I see. With thin archives, that is just going to cause the
same behaviour as built-in.o (everything will be linked). So the
build should not break, but they won't get savings.

Does it even save space with incremental linking? If the lib.a gets
linked into drivers/built-in.o, I wonder what happens then?

Thanks,
Nick
