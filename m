Indeed - I should have made that explicit in the Changelog.

Technically .SECONDARY is better - however it doesn't seem to work.
Running make with various debug toggles doesn't seem to be helping with why
.PRECIOUS works but not this.
That is also likely reason for a bunch of other .PRECIOUS entries in the same file
but no .SECONDARY.

I presume this is something not specific to ARC kernel or my host.
Can you try the .SECONDARY locally to see if it works for you.

Thx,
