There are lots of optimization passes and any of them might decide to
destroy dependencies.  :-(

The current state in the C++ committee is that marking variables
carrying dependencies is the way forward.  This is of course not what
the Linux kernel community does, but it should not be hard to have a
-fall-variables-dependent or some such that causes all variables to be
treated as if they were marked.  Though I was hoping for only pointers.
Are they -sure- that they -absolutely- need to carry dependencies
through integers???

Anyway, the next step is to provide this functionality in one of the
major compilers.  Akshat Garg started this in GCC as a GSoC project
by duplicating "volatile" functionality with a _Dependent_ptr keyword.
Next steps would include removing "volatile" functionality not required
for dependencies.  Here is a random posting, which if I remember correctly
raised some doubts as to whether "volatile" was really carried through
everywhere that it needs to for things like LTO:

https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc/2019-07/msg00139.html

What happened to this effort?  Akshat graduated and got an unrelated
job, you know, the usual.  ;-)
