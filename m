This one works "most of the time" but not always. What I found to work
reliably (until further notice ;)) is to force the vdso build like
below:

This was my last attempt at solving this. Unless someone has a better
idea or thinkg the above doesn't work (or it's uglier than Kevin's
original patch) I plan to merge it.

Other advantages are that it only generates a single vdso-offets.h file.
It also only rebuilds those objects that depend on vdso-offests.h rather
than everything under arch/arm64/kernel/ (Kevin's patch was also solving
this).
