Subject: [PATCH 1/3] kbuild: do not create built-in.a that is never linked to vmlinux
Date: Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:33:33 +0900
Message-Id: <20190912073336.7036-1-yamada.masahiro@socionext.com>
Sender: linux-kbuild-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kbuild.vger.kernel.org>
To: linux-kbuild@vger.kernel.org
Cc: Masahiro Yamada <yamada.masahiro@socionext.com>, Michal Marek <michal.lkml@markovi.net>, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Both 'obj-y += foo/' and 'obj-m += foo/' requrest Kbuild to visit the
sub-directory foo/, but the difference is that only the former combines
foo/built-in.a into the built-in.a of the current directory because
everything in sub-directories visited by obj-m is supposed to be modular.

So, it makes sense to create built-in.a only if that sub-directory is
reachable by the chain of obj-y. Otherwise, built-in.a will not be
linked into vmlinux anyway. If an orphan built-in.a is created, it is
very likely a Makefile bug.
