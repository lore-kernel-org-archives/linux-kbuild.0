Very nice patch!

This is something I'd certainly like to see upstream, and you made
a good point about keeping it seperate from the unicore32 submission.

One detail I don't like too much is that you now have two different
formats for specifying lists of headers to do something with.

Instead of the new arch/*/include/asm-generic file, how about listing
all files that are actually provided by the architecture as "header-y"
in arch/*/include/asm/Kbuild, and listing all files as something
else in include/asm-generic/Kbuild and include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm?
