Moving the EXPORT_SYMBOL into */ksyms.c would seem to make the
inclusion/exclusion of unused lib-y objects automatic:
With CONFIG_MODULES=y the EXPORT_SYMBOL in *ksyms.c would ensure it is
included.
With CONFIG_MODULES=n the EXPORT_SYMBOL would be preprocessed out and it
could be unused and excluded.

(although it is of course uglier to separate it from the definition).

Cheers
