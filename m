Right.

Exported symbols have C declarations in headers already. For the most
part, anyway -- these ones Arnd adds are for compiler runtime which is
why some architectures haven't had the prototypes.

Well, the reason is to get 4.9 working, I never thought asm-prototypes.h
was a beautiful solution or it should not be changed if we can find ways
to improve it.

EXPORT_SYMBOL_PROTO() for asm code seems possibly a good idea for 4.10.
Of course your exported symbols will still have their prototypes in
various headers -- that redundancy is inherent.

Thanks,
