This looks like a very complex solution to a simple problem.
We want a shared implementation of the *user space*
unaligned/endian accessor functions.
But do we really want *fast* versions for our use?

This is not a new libc that should generate optimal code,
but only something were we want to provide e working
implmentation for use in our user-space tools.

A much simpler approach without any fallback to arch specific
version etc. is everything we need.
