The importance of uapi headers presence is a bit overrated.

If you look at, for example, iptables (and further projects in that 
area), copies of uapi headers have been made (and this process is likely 
to continue) because it could be compiled on a variety of vintage 
systems that do not have all required #defines yet.

Similarly, it may be built on a variety of _modern_ systems whose 
kernels no longer have a particular thing (e.g. ipt_SAME), so it also 
ships copies of those headers.

So if some userspace component depends on that particular msr header (which,
unlike ipt_SAME, was not intended for export), is it not reasonable to expect
them to make a copy if and when they need it?
