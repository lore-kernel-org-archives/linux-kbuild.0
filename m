I don't see it makes any difference - the armksyms.c originally had
the same:

-#include <linux/export.h>
-#include <linux/sched.h>
-#include <linux/string.h>
-#include <linux/cryptohash.h>
-#include <linux/delay.h>
-#include <linux/in6.h>
-#include <linux/syscalls.h>
-#include <linux/uaccess.h>
-#include <linux/io.h>
-#include <linux/arm-smccc.h>
-
-#include <asm/checksum.h>
-#include <asm/ftrace.h>

followed by prototypes for the GCC internal functions, and:

-extern void fpundefinstr(void);
-
-void mmioset(void *, unsigned int, size_t);
-void mmiocpy(void *, const void *, size_t);

So, the asm-prototypes.h approach is just the same, only that we now
have a bunch of prototypes in a header file, and the EXPORT_SYMBOL()s
in the assembly files.

As the C prototypes are remote from the definitions, it means that
the C prototypes are going to get forgotten about in exactly the same
way that armksyms.c would've been forgotten about too.

It _is_ worse than that though - with the armksyms.c approach, if the
assembly code for it is removed, you get a build error reminding you
to remove the export (and prototype).  With this approach, you get no
reminder to touch asm-prototypes.h.

It's also error prone for another reason - adding a new assembly level
export, if you forget to add it to asm-prototypes.h, we're back into
the problem we have right now with MODVERSIONS breaking.

So, I still think the whole approach is wrong - it's added extra
fragility that wasn't there with the armksyms.c approach.
