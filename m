It doesn't matter so much for things that are just done for the kernel
compile, no, but there are some tools that are built to be used as
standalone things, and it could matter there.

Please note that the code currently doesn't have any arch-specific bits
at all... the code is somewhat complex in part because it is very
generic and handles several levels of fallback.  It *can* get
arch-specific overrides if it matters, but the intent is that it
shouldn't be necessary in the vast majority of the cases.
