After several pings by Al (sorry about that!), I got around to review a
rebased version of this patchset at

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git asm-exports

The kbuild commits are good, but since we are close to the end of the
merge window, I will apply them to my kbuild branch after 4.8-rc1.

Thanks,
Michal
