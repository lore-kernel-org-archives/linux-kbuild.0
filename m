Great. Many thanks for queuing this in -rcu. And regarding merge window
you mentioned, we're fine with your assumption to targeting the next
(v5.6) merge window.

I've just had a look at linux-next to check what a future rebase
requires:

- There is a change in lib/Kconfig.debug and moving KCSAN to the
  "Generic Kernel Debugging Instruments" section seems appropriate.
- bitops-instrumented.h was removed and split into 3 files, and needs
  re-inserting the instrumentation into the right places.

Otherwise there are no issues. Let me know what you recommend.

Thanks,
-- Marco
