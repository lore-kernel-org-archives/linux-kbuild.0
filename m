What's needed to support other architectures?

The part about the proper host compiler isn't clear to me. It looks
like each of three compilers are examined:
$CC for the header location
$HOSTCC for actually doing the build, or
$HOSTCXX for doing the plugin build?

Shouldn't the headers be coming from the compiler that is actually
going to be used to build the .so file?

Thanks! I'm looking forward to more plugins. :)
