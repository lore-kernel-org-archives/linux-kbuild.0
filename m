CC Andi and more DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT people.

Good to know that!

Yes DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT helps reduce build cost. Equally importantly,
it helps cut down the *.ko sizes, which saves boot test cost, too.
Since in our test scheme, the below modules.cgz will be loaded as part
of initrd on boot testing. Which will cost memory, and to the lesser
degree, IO and uncompressing time.

Here is the diff of the modules.cgz size:

Big files under /pkg/linux/x86_64-rhel-7.2+CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED/gcc-6/v4.14-rc7/,
comparing to +CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT:

=>    54M  135M  modules.cgz
     7.3M  7.3M  vmlinuz-4.14.0-rc7
     1.2M  1.2M  linux-headers.cgz
     7.6M  7.7M  linux-selftests.cgz
      31M   31M  linux-perf.cgz

Nevertheless, that's machine cost. If DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT hurts our
ability to analyze bugs, I think the forthright way would be to
disable it in our tests.

Thank you for the helpful information and appreciations!
I'll make the change to disable DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT.

Yes, we do. CC Rui and Aaron on power testing.

Rui/Aaron have better knowledge on the current status. It does look an
error-prone area that's worth more testing efforts.

>Anyway, regardless this was a good release for the 0day robot. Thanks.

My (and our) pleasure. I'd like to thank you and all the people who
take time to analyze/fix the bugs. It's great to see the long standing
bugs being fixed in mainline -- they have been a big source of noises
that hurt our auto bisect&reporting capabilities.
