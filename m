Yes, probably one could come up with coccinelle patches to do this,
preprocessing/string matching could have false positives. But as I wrote
above, we need one stable ABI and not multiple for our particular
kernels, so it seems like a lot of overhead to rename particular
functions internally all the time to make them inaccessible for external
modules.

Yes, I think this needs more experimentation and thought right now
before we can make a decision.

Agreed!

Thanks also,
