Consider substituting the Linux kernel for the DTB and make the same
statement to see if that sounds like a concern.

Then consider that in many cases a DTB could come from a Linux or
Android distribution, just like many Linux kernels do.  My understanding
is that the sources in the kernel tree used to make DTBs are gpl v2
and thus just as available as the source to a Linux kernel would be.

Yes, there are circumstances where I might find that the best way to
work on a problem.  I also often use debuggers to show me an assembly
display when debugging a kernel problem.  But I sometimes prefer to
start at the source code level.

Yes, bootloaders can cause issues.  This patch set is not intended to
deal with those problems.

btw, thank you for the references, concrete examples help a lot (and
they are interesting examples)!

I'm confused.  If the bootloader fiddles with the DTB then I can not
compare a hash of the DTB from the build host to a hash of the DTB
on the target.  Of course the bootloader can also fiddle with the
dtb-info if it wants to .  Bootloaders do what they want to do.  :-(

Exactly.  And the dtb version number will change when the DTB is
recompiled.

Different use cases for different people.

In all cases the absolute path includes the relative path, so it is
just a case of extra information.  The relative portion of the path
is still useful for anyone who wants to know what .dts was used in
the build, even if they don't have access to the build machine.
(They do have access to the gpl v2 source code, which will have
at least the relative portion of the path because that is needed
to build the DTB from the .dts.)

The extra information in the absolute path could be useful to a
build engineer, a distro engineer, or a support person for a distro.
Or could just be useless extra info.

If you distributed the DTB to me under the gpl v2 then you have also
either distributed the source to me or offered to make it available
to me.
