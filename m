../../../../../include/dt-bindings

And, I would expect only the headers that will actually be referenced
by kernel should go into include/dt-bindings.  There is no point to
put headers that will not be included by kernel but only by dts files
into there, and instead arch/arm/boot/dts/include should just be good
enough for them.  With this agreed ...
