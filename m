Hmmm. That's right.  That makes it much more justifiable.
My main objection is withdrawn.

However there is a bunch of includes added to asm-prototypes.h:

+#include <linux/arm-smccc.h>
+#include <linux/bitops.h>
+#include <linux/ftrace.h>
+#include <linux/io.h>
+#include <linux/platform_data/asoc-imx-ssi.h>
+#include <linux/string.h>
+#include <linux/uaccess.h>
+
+#include <asm/checksum.h>
+#include <asm/div64.h>
+#include <asm/memory.h>

Are those necessary at all?
