Right, but if it's only about interrupts, we're doing this already
inside modern Linux kernels.  On every single interrupt we are mixing
into a per-CPU "fast mix" pool the IP from the interrupt registers.

Since we're not claiming any additional entropy, I suppose it won't
hurt to do it twice, two different ways, but I'm not sure how much it
will actually help, and by doing the instrumentation in every single
basic block, instead of in the interrupt handler, I would think it
would be cheaper to do it in the interrupt handler.
