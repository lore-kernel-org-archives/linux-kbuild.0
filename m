Thanks for looking at this! I'll be including my hackbench
measurements for the v2 here in a moment.

I haven't found a stable network test yet. If someone can find a
reasonable workload, I'd love to hear about it.

I kind of think micro-benchmarks aren't so useful because they don't
represent a real-world workload. I've heard people talk about SAP-HANA
as a good test, but I can't get my hands on it. I wonder if anyone has
tried "mysqlslap"?
