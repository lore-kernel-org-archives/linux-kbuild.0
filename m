Yes, manual "marking" is never going to be a viable solution.

It should catch things if you change a structure layout of something
that is an argument in a function (like a pointer to a structure),
otherwise it wouldn't really be that good of a check, and kind of
useless.

It should be pretty good, as I think the code is based on the old SuSE
scripts that used to do this really well.  But it's been a long time
since I looked at it, so I could be wrong.

The goal is to be able to tell when a symbol changed somehow (structure
or function signature) and if it has, then to hopefully prevent loading
a module that doesn't have the same signature.  The distros really want
this as they want "external" modules to load properly, even when they
bump their main kernel package version.  And it's a good goal to have,
no need to rebuild external packages (that usually come from external
places) if you don't have to, as sometimes you need those modules to
have your machine to work properly (like the fibre channel mess of
out-of-tree drivers...)

So however that type of checking is done, is fine with me, I have no
real desire to mess with this as personally, I never use it for my own
machines (I just use module signing and then throw away the key after
building the kernel).
