Awesome! Thanks for testing this. I still need to finish getting my
arm64 environment built...

Do you happen to know if there's already a gcc bug open for the make
install problem?

Masahiro and Michal, does this series look good to you? I'd really
like to get this into -next for wider testing.

Emese, were you thinking of doing the initify plugin next after this
infrastructure lands?
