Yeah, I have to look that up every time.  :-/

Given the large number of additional optimizations that need to be
suppressed in the non-pointer case, any discouragement based on the "_ptr"
at the end of the name is all to the good.

And if that line of reasoning is unconvincing, please look at the program
at the end of this email, which compiles without errors with -Wall and
gives the expected output.  ;-)

Especially given that in C, _Atomic operations are implicitly volatile.
But this is likely a holdover from Akshat's implementation strategy,
which was to pattern _Dependent_ptr after the volatile keyword.

By requiring that any temporaries generated from variables that are
marked _Dependent_ptr also be marked _Dependent_ptr.  This is of course
one divergence of _Dependent_ptr from the volatile keyword.

Keep talking like this and I am going to make sure that you attend a
standards committee meeting.  If need be, by arranging for you to be
physically dragged there.  ;-)

More seriously, for control dependencies, the variable that would need
to be marked would be the program counter, which might require some
additional syntax.
