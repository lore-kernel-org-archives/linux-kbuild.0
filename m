The biggest pain point AFAICT is to identify what types (functions, 
structs, enums, ...) should be considered a part of the stable ABI. And 
the problem with modversions is that it pulls in just everything which 
gets (accidentally?) #included in the source file.
The actual ABI maintenance is a different problem, but there are many 
possible approaches, the _v2 suffix being one of them.
