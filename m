Looks like it's in the upstream tree:

https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=bfe972081c3c75019fa5a6e883dcbeb5e03eea18

I'm not sure how GCC does bug fix releases. Is this going to be in 5.4
or 5.3.1? (Is there such a thing as 5.3.1 planned?) I've CCed Jeff in
case he's got a moment to peek at this.

Yeah, absolutely. It works on the other architectures, and will soon
work on arm64 too.
