Good catch. I don't recall any special logic when I did that change,
so most likely I simply did like for the rest of the attributes and
took a look at when it was first supported (and documentation in gcc's
docs) in order to implement __has_attribute by hand.

But indeed, it *may* be that there is an (undocumented) problem
between 4.8 <= gcc < 4.9.2 with it. If so, we should document it down
and fix it. Andrey?

I missed that conflict completely, my bad (I did not miss all of them,
at least; one required fixing).

Hm.... at a quick look, why is it only on compiler-gcc.h? It should
either have a corresponding #define elsewhere or just be put directly
in another common header, no? (Adding Vasily & Martin to CC.)

I think that (using __has_attribute() outside) may be a good idea: I
wanted to keep compiler_attributes.h as simple as possible by avoiding
#ifdefs inside that header (except for __has_attribute itself), as an
attempt to avoid going back to the mess of #ifdefs we had previously.
Basically, keeping the attributes in compiler_attributes.h that do not
depend on complex logic. So using __has_attribute *outside* the header
actually goes well with that principle, because it helps keeping stuff
out of it if they depend on other config options; without having to
rely on GCC_VERSION either.

[By the way, in case it clarifies: note that "optional" in that file
actually is a bit of a misnomer. I meant to say "optional" as in "not
supported by all compilers, so conditionally defined" ("optionally"
defined); rather than "optional" in the sense of "code still works
without the attribute". It caught Rasmus in one of his patches sent a
few days ago on top of this tree, so I want to change it or explain it
to avoid confusion.]

Cheers,
Miguel
