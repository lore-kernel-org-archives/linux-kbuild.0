Ok, can you include multi_v5_defconfig than?

I see you have one named "arm-arm5", which may be the same.

I have around 130 patches for warnings that I'm submitting at the moment, but
there are a couple of really tricky ones that I don't currently have
a good plan for:

- in some configurations, you end up without any boards selected, hitting
  an #error in the final link
- ARMv3 support in gcc is rather broken and causes internal compiler errors
  among other things
- the old ELF format (OABI) doesn't work in some cases
- GCOV_PROFILE_ALL causes problems that need to be debugged
- XIP_KERNEL sometimes causes kallsyms to fail
- not all platforms implement the complete clk API, if they don't
  use CONFIG_COMMON_CLK (I have patch for that we can probably merge)
- CONFIG_PHYS_OFFSET needs to be entered manually to be a number
  in 'make config'
- same for DEBUG_LL
