I prefer Stephen's version because that maintains the type checking.
However, that is not a controversial point at all IMHO. The question
that we need to decide on is whether we want automatic "generic-y"
statements in Kbuild.asm.

I'm not opposed to the idea, but I can imagine some arch maintainers
fine it confusing. When you first posted the patch, I spent some
time trying to get the wildcard logic moved to scripts/Makefile.asm-generic
and scripts/Makefile.headersinst but couldn't figure it out in the end.

I would definitely prefer being able to just write 

generic-y += clkdev.h 

in include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm, rather than 

ifeq ($(wildcard $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/asm/clkdev.h),)
generic-y += clkdev.h
endif

Maybe Michal Marek or someone on the kbuild mailing list can help
out with a solution for that.
