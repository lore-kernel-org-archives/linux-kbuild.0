I was thinking the build matrix (architectures x build options x toolchains)
is a bit too large to switch it for everybody. I've far from even tested it
for a fraction of powerpc builds. I would prefer arch maintainers to switch
it themselves, but I do hope we can move everybody and just remove the old
method within a few releases.

But I'm happy to go with whatever arch and kbuild maintainers prefer, so I
appreciate any discussion on it.

Thanks,
Nick
