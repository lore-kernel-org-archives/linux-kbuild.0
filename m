I think we're ok with upgrading that. We've been allowing some
ridiculously old tools at times. I think "feature is 10 years old and
actively used by other projects" (Qt uses it from some googling, for
example) is more than sufficient.

If somebody has user space older than that, they presumably aren't
building new kernels either.
