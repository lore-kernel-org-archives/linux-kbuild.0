Yeah, breaking Kconfig is a sure way to feel the wrath.

The only reason I feel somewhat confident modifying Kconfig is that
the Kconfiglib test suite happens to work as a regression test for the
C implementation as well. It compares the .config files produced by
the two implementations for all defconfig files and for
all{no,yes,def}config, for all ARCHes, meaning any changes to the
output of the C tools get flagged as well (with a diff).

Having some "native" tests is great as well. I'm a big fan of
automatic testing. :)

In case you want to run the Kconfiglib test suite at any point, here's
how to do it (in the kernel root):

        $ git clone git://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib.git
        $ git am Kconfiglib/makefile.patch
        $ python Kconfiglib/testsuite.py speedy

Cheers,
Ulf
