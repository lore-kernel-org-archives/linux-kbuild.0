Wonderful! Any problems doing that for x86_64 ?

I agree 100%. When I added this the first time, it was at the request
of the ARM maintainer, who was reluctant to rely on Perl for some
reason.

Recently, we have had to add a kludge to prevent spurious rebuilds of
the .S_shipped files as well.

I'd be perfectly happy to get rid of this entirely, and always
generate the .S from the .pl, which to me is kind of the point of
carrying these files in the first place.

Masahiro: do you see any problems with this?
