This is a fundamental issue with the approach: if bootloaders  mess with
the DTB, then the provenance information is at best misleading.

If bootloaders don't mess with the DTB, then a hash gives you reliable
provenance information, provided you have a DB of the hashes of DTBs
you've shipped. If you're already in the habit of distributing binaries
that should be fine, and if you're not then it presumably doesn't matter
anyway.

Consider having to work around stale object issues in the build system
with git clean -fdx or similar. While unfortunate, this is sometimes
necessary. Due to this, I build two different DTBs with exactly the same
"version".

If you need to tell these apart, you can do that by hash. You don't need
the "version" to do so.

(and yes, I am aware that the same is true of the kernel).

Given the reservations that have been expressed so far, it sounds like
the set of negative use cases is larger than the set of positives.

I very much suspect it will end up being the latter. For example I've
seen various iterations of certain FW ship with all-zero ID numbers, for
which the use-cases of said ID numbers are exactly those you mention
above.

As far as I can see, the only consistent and sane way to identify a
binary object is by its hash, which for obvious reasons cannot be
encoded within itself (though can be computed consistently).

That being the case you don't care about the fields; we've established
that they're meaningless to the end user.

Were I to have distributed files to you, I would have archived the
relevant build (with source, config, and so on). I can look up what I've
distributed to you and hand you the source without needing additional
properties in the DTB.

Mark.
