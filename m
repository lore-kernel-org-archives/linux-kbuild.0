A minimal example would be

t1.c:
struct s1;
struct s2 {
	int i;
}
struct s3 {
	struct s1 *ptr1;
	struct s2 *ptr2;
}
void foo(struct s3*);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo);

t2.c:
struct s1 {
	int j;
}
struct s2;
struct s3 {
	struct s1 *ptr1;
	struct s2 *ptr2;
}
void foo(struct s3*);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo);

genksyms expands this to
void foo ( struct s3 { struct s1 { UNKNOWN } * ptr1 ; struct s2 { int i ; } * ptr2 ; } * )

or

void foo ( struct s3 { struct s1 { int j ; } * ptr1 ; struct s2 { UNKNOWN } * ptr2 ; } * )

respectively. The types are the same, but their visibility in the
different compilation units differs.
