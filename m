I tracked this down as well now, and it's also a problem on my
local machine, your patches are fine. In order to debug
the other problem, I was building with
"make LD=/home/arnd/..../ld" to try out different
versions of the linker, and that caused the "LD += -EB"
line from arch/arm/Makefile to be ignored.

We should probably override LDFLAGS rather than LD
(and AFLAGS instead of AS) for big-endian builds, but
that is unrelated to your work.
