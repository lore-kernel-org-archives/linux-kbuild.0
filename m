As per our discussion, I'd add that this was inadvertedly introduced
by Behan when he moved the clang specific warnings into an ifdef block
and did not notice that -Wsign-compare was interpreted by both gcc
and clang.

Earlier, it was introduced in just the same way by Jan-Simon as part
of 3d3d6b847420 ("kbuild: LLVMLinux: Adapt warnings for compilation with clang").

The new patch looks good to me, please add

Acked-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Fixes: 26ea6bb1fef0 ("kbuild, LLVMLinux: Supress warnings unless W=1-3")

I've started looking into building the kernel with clang, and will likely
follow up with further unrelated changes to the list, as clang-3.9
seems to generate a couple of extra warnings we want to suppress.
