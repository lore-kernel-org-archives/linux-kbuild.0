You said "that'd be incorrect", but
there is no "correct" or "incorrect" in either way as long as it works.

This decision varies from project to project.

At least in Linux, it generally uses #include <file> style
except ones in local directories.
I guess it is debatable if this rule also applies to host tools or not.

To sum up, your suggestion for GCC plugins is

  - Use #include <...> to include header files provided by the host compiler
  - Use #include "..." to include header files provided by the cross
compiler (plugin directory)
  - Use #include "..." to include header files in the local project

Correct?

I leave the final decision to others.
