YES YES YES!!!

Now I don't work on a distro anymore, but I would think that something
like this would be really useful, pointing out exactly what changed is
very important for distro maintainers to determine what they want to do
(either fix up the abi change with strange hacks, or ignore it due to
the change being in an area they don't care at all about, i.e. a random
driver subsystem.)

So yes, I think this is really good stuff.  But if the distro
maintainers correct me and think it's useless, then I need to revisit my
view of exactly what they do for their customers :)
