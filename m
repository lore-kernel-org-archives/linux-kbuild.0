Yes, it is different.  With gc-sections the linker simply drops code 
sections that have no references to them. This is therefore fast and low 
complexity.  LTO postpones the compiler's code optimization passes at 
the point where everything is linked together and can do things like 
constant propagation across multiple files, etc. LTO is therefore more 
efficient at removing unused code but compilation time is much longer 
due to the added complexity and inherent difficulty to parallelize the 
operation across multiple CPUS.

I think we should aim for gc-sections to be used by default and have LTO 
as a possible option only.
