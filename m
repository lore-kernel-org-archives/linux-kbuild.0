Agree completely. BTW (for those who might be looking into these tools),
we also have https://github.com/skozina/kabi-dw that Stanislav (cc'ed)
mentioned earlier.

It's true that the current modversions __crc_ matching infrastructure is
"just" a symbol versioning system, and we could keep it and just populate
it with something other than genksyms (e.g., a symbol version list provided
by distros). But the starting point should be *no* versioning and simply
using names to break linkage. Unless there's a compelling reason not to,
symbols are simpler, easier, everyone knows how they work.

The other question would be whether to pull a minimal tool into the kernel
source or keep them out of tree (but possibly add some helper scripts etc).
I guess we'll need to see what distros want.

Thanks,
Nick
