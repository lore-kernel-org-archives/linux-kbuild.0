A few people have been interested in this again. And I promised
if it remains dead code it should be removed, so I would like to
have another try.

I think I got snagged on the modules problem last time and did
not take the time to work it out, this time I just turned off the
compile options for modules (the linker option was never set anyway
so no loss).

This includes some linker script catches and ideas from others, I
didn't documnt them all, but thanks for looking.

I would be interested to help other archs get this working too, if
anybody needs some help.

Thanks,
Nick
