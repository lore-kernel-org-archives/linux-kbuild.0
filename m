I think I agree in principle - Makefiles are already unreadable enough 
without a million special cases.

If someone else is willing to write up that advice, then great.

We can't build without tm.h: http://pastebin.com/W0azfCr0

And we get warnings without c-common.h: http://pastebin.com/Aw8CAj10

These were all manually built using a script running on a Debian box. 
Installing precompiled distro versions of rather old gccs would have 
been somewhat challenging. I've just rebuilt 4.6.4 to double check that 
I wasn't just seeing things, but it seems that it definitely is still 
putting c-common.h in the old location.
